<hr class="mediumfr" />

<p class="p2"><span class="sc ls">Having</span> read in the earliest portion of my life
the small part of Mr. Hals’ Parochial History published
about the year 1750, I entertained from that
time a strong desire for seeing the remainder also
in print; this desire grew up with my years, increased
perhaps by an understanding that the
manuscript had disappeared, no one seemed to
know in what way, and that it might possibly have
been destroyed.</p>

<p>At last, the manuscript was recovered by the
most justly celebrated Mr. Whitaker, from a bookseller
at Exeter, who had retained the papers as a
pledge for some debt; from Mr. Whitaker they
have come to his son-in-law Richard Taunton,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> M.D. who has with great liberality placed
them in my hands; mutilated, however, as to the
histories of several parishes, from want of care and
of attention on the part of the individual holding
them as a deposit, although he must have deemed
them to be of pecuniary value.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin’s papers were preserved by his niece
Miss Fosse, who died more than fifty years ago,
at a place that may now be termed, without offence,
the village of Michell. This lady must have
been the last of Mr. Tonkin’s near relations; for,
although the property left at her decease could
<!--006.png--><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii"></a><span class="pageno">ii</span>
not have amounted to anything of importance,
the funeral was attended by many scores of persons,
claiming shares of whatever could be found.
Under such circumstances every moveable was
soon converted into money, and the manuscript
of the Parochial History, complete as Mr. Tonkin
left it, got into the possession of Lord Dunstanville,
by whom it was instantly offered to me, on
my preparing to edit the Parochial History of Mr.
Hals. And as Mr. Tonkin copied largely from
Mr. Hals, many of the lost parishes are at least
partially supplied.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Lysons got possession of a beautifully
transcribed copy of the whole that remains
of Mr. Hals’ Parochial History; this was purchased
at the sale of his books by the Earl of Aylesford,
who without any personal acquaintance whatever,
has had the liberality to allow me the use of this
splendid folio volume, during the whole time of my
work passing through the press.</p>

<p>Mr. Gregor has supplied me with an original
copy of the last Heraldic Visitation of Cornwall;
and to Doctor Boase I am indebted for a geological
description of every parish.</p>

<p>Previously to my taking this task on myself, I
endeavoured to preserve the works of Mr. Hals
and Mr. Tonkin for the public, by the more easy
expedient of advancing money in aid of the publication;
but not having obtained success, I at
last adventured on what is now done, little aware,
however, of the pains, and time, required for editing
the histories of more than two hundred parishes;
<!--007.png--><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii"></a><span class="pageno">iii</span>
although I have to a considerable extent relieved
myself from the most irksome duty of correcting
the press, by obtaining the assistance of Messrs.
Nichols and Son, on the condition of their taking,
what is very unlikely to accrue, any profit arising
from the publication, and my sustaining, the more
probable alternative, all the loss.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals’ work is given without alteration,
except considerable omissions of long histories,
from the Bollandists and other writers of legends,
relative to obscure Saints, little known, or deserving
of being known; and in many cases owing
their supposed connection with Cornwall, entirely
to the writer’s imagination; and in the opposite
extreme, of the lives of personages most worthy of
being preserved and studied in general history, of
Apostles, of Emperors of Rome, and Kings, but
quite as irrelevant as the former, to a History
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>I have been also unable to retain the greater
part of the derivations assigned to the names of
manors, families, or places; they are generally referred
to some word of a similar sound in modern
English, after a manner scarcely less ludicrous
than the mock etymologies of Dr. Swift.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have omitted various anecdotes, containing
simple scandal, without any thing illustrative
of the age or country.</p>

<p>Other anecdotes of a public nature are retained;
on a conviction that events long passed by, and
incapable from their very nature of being suppressed,
neither will, nor ought to excite any unpleasing
<!--008.png--><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv"></a><span class="pageno">iv</span>
feeling in the minds of those who may be
directly or collaterally descended from the persons
to whom they relate.</p>

<p>I have not throughout the whole work intentionally
used a single expression disrespectful to
any one, nor have I retained from either of the
manuscripts, nor added of my own one new anecdote
or tale capable by possibility of giving the
least pain.</p>

<p>If an expression should be found, which in the
opinion of any individual is at variance with these
assertions, I beg permission to apologize before I
am accused, and to declare that the fault has been
involuntary, and that I am not aware, at this
instant, of any such fault existing.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has mainly copied from Mr. Hals,
and these portions of course have not been
printed over again; but all his additions are preserved,
with the greater part of his derivations,
apparently much more accurate than those they
are intended to confute.</p>

<p>Here it would have been wise, certainly it would
have been prudent, for me to have concluded the
work; but having acquired, through the course of
a long life, the knowledge of many incidents,
which, although of little general importance, may
amuse persons taking an interest even in trifles
connected with their immediate neighbourhoods,
I have been induced to add under each parish,
such matters as happened to occur to my recollection;
using also in many cases the information
drawn by Mr. Lysons from sources accessible
<!--009.png--><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a><span class="pageno">v</span>
only to himself, in consequence of his situation in
the Tower.</p>

<p>I have further had recourse to the works treating
on monasteries and religious establishments;
but without considering myself bound or pledged
to make out a complete history in any case, either
by researches into documents not in my possession,
or, still less, (at my time of life and distant residence)
by investigations on the spot.</p>

<p>This part of the work will be found very unequally
executed; but it was never intended to be
otherwise.</p>

<p>At the end of each parish I have added the
common statistics:&mdash;the number of acres from
the measurement of Mr. Hitchins; the value of
the real property; the account of poor rate, and
of the population at the four periods of numeration,
from the Parliamentary Returns. And through
the great kindness and liberality of Doctor Boase,
I have been enabled to subjoin to these the geology
of each parish, deduced from an actual survey
in person of the whole county, by that very intelligent
and experienced geologist, chemist, and physiologist.</p>

<p>And here it may be right to observe, that, as
the formations are not merely similar, but identical,
over many contiguous parishes, and again in
parishes disjoined from each other, the plan of referring
from one to another became indispensable,
to avoid repetition after repetition, and adding,
without any utility, to the size of the work.</p>

<p>In the form of Appendices will be found several
<!--010.png--><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><span class="pageno">vi</span>
matters relative to Cornwall, either not previously
in print, or that cannot be obtained separately
from large works, of which they form a part.</p>

<p>Mr. Scawen’s Works, so far as they are contained
in the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>Leland’s Itinerary.</p>

<p>Drayton’s Polyolbion.</p>

<p>The Transcript of a Manuscript from the British
Museum; proving, I believe, that even Mr. Whitaker,
one without doubt among our most able and
learned antiquaries, may be mistaken on a subject
connected with the objects of his peculiar research.</p>

<p>There will be also some miscellaneous matters,
and among them an Index to Mr. Carew’s History;
an addition greatly demanded also by another work,
which would then become the most useful Corpus
Historicum relating to our county.</p>

<p>There are several other manuscripts of Mr.
Tonkin, chiefly copies from Mr. Hals of pedigrees,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> but these I have not touched. And I have
purposely abstained from every general topic relating
to the county at large, as these have been
amply discussed by our various historians.</p>

<p>The first in order of time, the most interesting
and most entertaining, is Mr. Carew.</p>

<p>This work was first published in 1602, a second
edition came out in 1723, and a third, chiefly
through the exertions of the late Mr. John Price
of Penzance, in 1769. But the edition far exceeding
all the others, with highly valuable additions, and
with copious notes, was given to the public in
1811 by the late Lord Dunstanville, in one <abbr title="volume quarto">vol. 4to</abbr>,
<!--011.png--><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a><span class="pageno">vii</span>
457 pages, with an excellent engraving of the
author, from a picture at Anthony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Richard Carew</span> was of a very ancient and
respectable family; he inherited Anthony from a
long line of ancestors, and has transmitted it to
his descendants.</p>

<p>Wood says, in the Athenæ Oxonienses, that he
was born in the year 1555, became a gentleman
commoner of Christ Church at a very early age,
but had his chambers in Bradgate Hall (since
Pembroke College), and that at fourteen he disputed,
extempore, with Sir Philip Sidney, in the
presence of several distinguished visitants to the
university.</p>

<p>After three years’ residence at Oxford, Mr. Carew
removed to the Middle Temple, where he
passed three years more, and then went with his
uncle on an embassy to Poland.</p>

<p>In the year 1577 Mr. Carew married Juliana
Arundell, of Trerice, and served the office of
Sheriff in 1586. It is recorded that he was intimate
with most of the noted scholars of those
times, and especially with Sir Henry Spelman.</p>

<p>He died in November 1620, and is buried in his
parish church of Anthony, (see the epitaph, p. <abbr title="twenty-four">xxiv</abbr>).</p>

<p>Mr. Carew’s life is given in considerable detail
as an introduction to his History of Cornwall. He
wrote and translated several other works; but
they seem not to have survived.</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Carew’s History, Mr. <span class="sc">John Norden’s</span>
was composed, with the title of “Speculi
Britanniæ Pars. A Topographical and Historical
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a><span class="pageno">viii</span>
Description of Cornwall, by the Perambulation,
View, and Delineation of John Norden.”</p>

<p>This work has been well characterized by Mr.
Tonkin, as “a mean performance, full of egregious
mistakes, with most defective and erroneous
maps of every hundred, yet containing several
things in it not to be met with elsewhere.”</p>

<p>Our next historian, but after a considerable interval
of time, was Mr. <span class="sc">William Scawen</span>, a fragment
only of whose work is known to be extant,
and which will appear in these volumes.</p>

<p>He was of an ancient family, well educated, and
possessed of an ample fortune. He represented
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s in Parliament, and received the appointment
of Vice-Warden of the Stannaries, immediately
after the Restoration of King Charles
the Second.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin I have not any
better information than what is given by Mr. Lysons.
He says:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“About the year 1685, Mr. <span class="sc">William Hals</span>, a
gentleman of an ancient Devonshire family, which
had been some time settled at Fentongollan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael-Penkevill, began to make collections for a
parochial history of Cornwall, which he continued
for at least half a century; it was brought down
by him to about the year 1736. Mr. Hals died in
1739; his parochial history being at that time
nearly completed. About the year 1750, the publication
of this work was undertaken by Mr. Andrew
Brice, then a printer at Truro, who afterwards removed
to Exeter, where he published an useful geographical
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a><span class="pageno">ix</span>
dictionary and other books. The account
of seventy-two parishes arranged alphabetically,
from Advent to Helston inclusive, was printed in
folio in ten numbers, which are extremely scarce.
The publication is said to have been suspended for
want of purchasers; occasioned by the scurrilous
anecdotes it contained, and reflections thrown on
some of the principal families. It is probable, however,
that the inaccuracies with which it abounds,
and the tedious legends of saints to whom the
churches are dedicated, which occupy at least half
the work, would have operated more to the prejudice
of its sale than the scandalous anecdotes
which occasionally occur, many of which had been
omitted by the editor. The most valuable part of
the work is the account of families and the descent
of property; but in these he is frequently
inaccurate; and, as Dr. Borlase observes, ‘what
he says should not have too great stress laid upon
it, when it stands upon his single authority.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Contemporary with Hals, as a collector of
materials for a parochial history of Cornwall, was
<span class="sc">Thomas Tonkin</span>, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Trevaunance, some time
member for Helston, a gentleman of an ancient
family, who had made great progress in preparing
such a history for the press, and had completed
several parishes. Mr. Tonkin began to write his
parochial history in 1702, at which time he had
the use of Hals’s collections. Dr. Borlase seems
to have supposed that Hals’s collections were
brought down from 1702 to 1736 by Tonkin; the
truth is, that they both brought down their collections
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a><span class="pageno">x</span>
to that period, without any communication
with each other, which seems to have ceased soon
after the first period above-mentioned. Mr. Tonkin
himself says, speaking of Hals in the year
1739, ‘it is between twenty-five and thirty years
since I have seen any of his collections, and, I believe,
at least twenty since I have seen him. I
am told that he has greatly improved and polished
them since that time; but as his method is quite
different from mine, and that I have some other
reasons not necessary to be mentioned for not corresponding
with him, I can safely say, that in this
present work of mine, I have not made use of one
single line out of his compositions.’ Mr. Tonkin,
in one of his <abbr title="manuscript">MSS.</abbr> dated March 27th, 1733, desires
that, ‘if by death, or any other accident, his <abbr title="manuscript">MSS.</abbr>
should fall into other hands, they would by no
means publish them in the dress in which they
then appeared, but be pleased to new-model them
after the method followed in those few which had
received his last corrections, such as at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Piran in the Sands, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael-Penkevil,’ <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
In 1737 he had made sufficient progress in his collections
to enable him to put forth proposals, in
which he announced the plan of his publication.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the year 1739, Mr. Tonkin had completed
his MS. of the first part of his work, which was to
treat of the county of Cornwall in general; his
epistle dedicatory of that date is printed at the
beginning of Lord de Dunstanville’s edition of Carew,
addressed to Sir William Carew, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and
Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> then representatives in
<!--015.png--><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a><span class="pageno">xi</span>
Parliament for the county of Cornwall. In this
letter he recapitulates what had been done towards
the topography of his native county. Besides the
works of Leland, Camden, Norden, and Carew, he
mentions the general collections of Hals and Anstis,
and those of Pearce and Gwavas on the Stannaries,
the Cornish language, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Towards the
conclusion of his epistle, he says, ‘I wish I could
say that many more of my countrymen had assisted
me with their kind endeavours. I do not
yet despair of having several; for which reasons I
have, in my proposals, enlarged the designed time
of the publication of this part. I hope they will
be so good as to send in contributions. If they
persist in their refusal, they must be contented
with such coarse fare as I am able to give them,
which I will endeavour to make as palatable for
them as I can; perhaps, when they come to taste
of this, they may be prevailed on to supply me with
something better towards the two remaining parts.
All that I can promise them is, that I will give
them the best account I can, without the least partiality;
neither shall any one person have a just
occasion given him to charge me with any wilful
omission or sophisticated truth.”</p>

<p>Very little was done by Mr. Tonkin to the parochial
department of his intended history after
the date of this letter; he died in 1742, and in
the latter part of his life, being unhappily involved
in pecuniary difficulties, he grew less attentive to
study, and died without printing any part of his
intended history.</p>

<p><!--016.png--><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a><span class="pageno">xii</span>
Doctor <span class="sc">William Borlase</span> more than meditated
a parochial history, having made some collections
towards it. If this design had been carried into
execution, all further attempts might have been
deemed superfluous.</p>

<p>His Antiquities and Natural History of Cornwall
gave ample proof of the ability, the ingenuity,
and of the diligence possessed by this excellent
man, who had the deserved good fortune of being
equally esteemed and admired, not by the neighbourhood
alone, but by the most learned and scientific
persons throughout Europe.</p>

<p>The Antiquities were first published in 1754.</p>

<p>The second edition in 1769.</p>

<p>The Natural History in 1758. All in quarto.</p>

<p>Respecting the Natural History, it may be expedient
to remind the reader, that in the last edition
of Chambers’s Encyclopædia, four volumes of
the largest size, with one volume of plates, printed
in 1783, the very word Geology does not occur;
and that some years later, chemical lectures were
publicly given on the phlogistic theory of Becher
and Stahl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Polwhele</span> has published in seven parts, beginning
with the date 1803, and ending with that
of 1816, making in all two quarto volumes, of
about 1200 pages, in small type, and abounding
with notes and extracts in a type still smaller, an
immense collection of matter relative to the antiquities,
the biography, the literature, the history
military and civil, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> of Cornwall; arranged under
distinct heads, and enriched with prints of distinguished
persons, with figures of ancient castles,
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a><span class="pageno">xiii</span>
churches, monuments, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and with views of towns,
and of romantic scenery. One is astonished at
the great labour bestowed on this work, and still
more so when it is recollected, that the author has
distinguished himself in every branch of elegant
literature, and most of all in that department, where
the fire of genius is believed somewhat to diminish
the aptitude for patient toil.</p>

<p>The next work on Cornwall deserves particular
attention on various grounds,&mdash;its extensive plan,
arrangement, and parochial history, and the situation
in life of its author, Mr. <span class="sc">C. S. Gilbert</span>, who at
the time of his executing “An Historical Survey of
the County of Cornwall; to which is added a complete
Heraldry of the same, with numerous engravings,”
resided as a druggist in Plymouth or
Devonport; and he is said to have acquired a
knowledge of this trade by accompanying one of
those itinerant doctors in medicine, who are in the
habit of attracting customers by exhibitions little
suited to the gravity of a profound science.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert is understood to have collected information
which induced him to believe, that he
might claim a descent from the Gilberts of Compton
Castle; and under that persuasion he applied
himself to the study of antiquities, with genealogy,
heraldry, and every collateral science, which led
him by degrees to undertake the History of Cornwall,
and to complete it in two quarto volumes,
usually bound in three; all which he executed
with such eagerness, zeal, and disregard of expense,
as to involve him during the latter part of
<!--018.png--><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a><span class="pageno">xiv</span>
his life in considerable difficulties. For Compton
Castle, and the family from which this gentleman
thought himself derived, and which is now represented
by the Reverend J. Pomeroy Gilbert, of
Bodmin, see Prince’s Worthies of Devon, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 420,
edition of 1810.</p>

<p>About the same time that Mr. C. S. Gilbert’s
work appeared, another very similar to it came out
sanctioned by the names of Mr. <span class="sc">Samuel Drew</span> of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, well known by his profound metaphysical
writings, and of Mr. <span class="sc">Malachy Hitchins</span>, son
of the celebrated astronomer, who, residing at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Hilary, three hundred miles from London, conducted
the Nautical Almanack from the second
year of its appearance 1768, to the conclusion of
his life in 1809, during a period of more than forty
years.</p>

<p>A well written and perspicuous life of Mr. Drew,
has been given to the public by his son Mr. Jacob
Halls Drew, in which many interesting particulars
are given of this distinguished writer; together with
a fair and impartial account of his various works,
of which the most known, and perhaps the best, is
his Essay on the Human Soul. This treatise, published
in 1802, contains every argument that can
be found in the Phædon of Plato, with additions;
and the whole is not inferior to its prototype. But
the observation of an ancient peripatetic philosopher,
Alexander of Appodisia, a city of Caria in
Lesser Asia, is equally applicable to both:</p>

<p class="blockquote">Αλλ’ εστι πολλα των ὁντων, ἁ την μεν ὑπαρξιν εχει γνωριμωτατην,
αγνωστοτατην δε την ουσιαν· ὡσπερ ἡτε Κινησις, και ὁ
<!--019.png--><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a><span class="pageno">xv</span>
Τοπος, ετι δε μαλλον ὁ Χρονος. Εκαστου γαρ τουτων το μεν
ειναι γνωριμον και αναμφιλεκτον· τις δε ποτε εστιν αυτων ἡ ουσια
των χαλεπωτατων οραθηναι.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Εστι δε δη τι των τοιουτων και Ἡ Ψυχη· το μεν γαρ ειναι τι την
Ψυχην γνωριμωτατον και φανερωτατον· τι δε ποτε εστιν, ου ῥαδιον
καταμαθειν.</p>

<p>Our reason convinces us of its own separate
existence apart from matter and organization; beyond
that, we must submit to learn from higher
authority.</p>

<p>Alexander, therefore, does not go beyond the
sphere of human knowledge, when he adds of the
soul as capable of a separate existence, Μηδε την
αρχην Οργανῳ τινι Σωματικῳ προσχρησθαι προς την ληψιν των
νοουμενων, αλλ’ αρκεισθαι αυτον αυτῳ προς το γνωναι το νοουμενον.</p>

<p>Mr. Hitchins gave several proofs of genius; but
his life was cut short at an early period.</p>

<p>Various descriptions and accounts of local districts,
and of particular places in Cornwall may be
found; of these I shall mention three as by far
the best, and highly deserving of attention.</p>

<p>Topographical and Historical Sketches of the
Boroughs of East and West Looe, with an account
of the Natural and Artificial Curiosities and Picturesque
Scenery in the Neighbourhood. By Thomas
Bond, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Dr. Maton’s Tour; and</p>

<p>A Guide to the Mount’s Bay and the Land’s
End. By Dr. Paris.</p>

<p>As this must in all probability be the last time
of my addressing the inhabitants of my native
county through the medium of any permanent
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a><span class="pageno">xvi</span>
work, I shall so far presume as to offer a few lines
respecting myself, nearly in the words used by two
among the most distinguished of modern writers.</p>

<p>Since it has pleased Almighty God so to constitute
the world, that the human race should every
where increase up to the very limit of subsistence,
all countries must witness by far the greater portion
of their inhabitants exposed to the dangers of
privation, of poverty, and of distress, incapable of being
mitigated in any way, except by the prudence,
the care, and the general good conduct of the parties
themselves; but easily and fatally susceptible of
being augmented, almost to an unlimited degree,
by the establishment of permanent charities, by
distributions in the shape of largesses, and above all,
by the greatest and most melancholy achievement
of human weakness and short-sighted folly, the
English system of poor laws, extending premiums
to idleness and improvidence, on a basis of indefinite
relief to claimants multiplying without end.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“My lot might have been thrown among
these; it might have been that of a savage,
or a slave: nor can I reflect without gratitude
on the bounty of Nature, which has cast
my birth in a free and civilized country, in a
family decently endowed with the gifts of Fortune,
in an age of science and of philosophy,
where years outrun in discoveries and in improvements
the advances of former centuries.”</p>

<p>It is not for me to determine how far these advantages
have been improved by myself; but at
the age of threescore years and ten, I may justly
say with the other writer alluded <span class="lock">to&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--021.png--><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a><span class="pageno">xvii</span>
“The retrospect of life recalls to my view many
opportunities of good neglected, much time squandered
upon trifles, and more lost in idleness and
vacancy. I leave many great designs unattempted,
and many great attempts unfinished; but, my mind
being free from the burden of any heavy crime, I
compose myself to tranquillity: I endeavour to
abstract my thoughts from hopes and cares,
which, though reason knows them to be vain, still
try to keep their old possession of my heart: I
humbly expect the hour which Nature cannot
long delay; and with the most profound adoration
of the Divinity, I hope to possess in a better state
of existence, that happiness which here I could
not find, and that virtue which here I have been
unable to attain.”</p>

</p>

<p>The only existing Manuscript of Mr. Tonkin’s
Work having remained for some years in the possession
of Mr. Whitaker, he added to it various
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix"></a><span class="pageno">xix</span>
notes and ilustrations, frequently interlined, or
blended with the original writing, so as to render
the task difficult, in many cases, to distinguish
the one from the other. In almost every passage
of any length, Mr. Whitaker’s additions are marked
with a [W.]</p>

<p>Geology having pressed forward during the
present century, at a pace unexampled in other
sciences, may reasonably be expected to reach new
discoveries in comparatively short intervals of
time; these have been reduced, however, almost
to instants in respect to Cornwall. After the very
able, minute, and laborious investigation made by
Doctor Boase, of every district, of every parish in
the whole county, the work of discovery would
seem to have been completed, at the least for several
years; but Mr. de la Beche came soon afterwards
into Cornwall, under the sanction of Government,
assisted by officers of the Engineers
employed on the great Trigonometrical Survey; and
this eminent Geologist has, in consequence, been
enabled to lay down the various main lodes, the
cross courses, the elvans, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> together with the
junctions of granite, greenstone, and killas, with
an accuracy and discrimination never before attained,
nor ever approximated to, except by Mr.
Richard Thomas, in his survey of the mining district,
made about twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. De la Beche has also been enabled to deduce
several general laws observed in the direction of
cleavages, in the dip of strata, in the heaves and
slides of lodes, all of which will be detailed in an
eagerly expected volume, together with a discovery
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx"></a><span class="pageno">xx</span>
most unexpected. The saxa metallifera of Cornwall
had always been supposed referable to a very
remote period of geological epochs, far anterior
to the age of organic remains; till this opinion
became shaken by the discovery of shells, or of
their impressions, in the hard schist rocks near
Tintagell: others were subsequently found more to
the south and west; till at last Mr. De la Beche has
detected the remains of organized life adjacent to
a productive Copper Lode.</p>

<p>Two other eminent geologists, whom it would be
equally idle and presumptuous for me to praise,
have established the fact of a formation in the
northern parts of Cornwall and Devon, not less
unexpected than the discovery just noticed.</p>

<p>Professor Sedgwick and Mr. Murchison having
investigated the deep-seated rocks in Wales, and
in the adjacent districts, have finally traced the
carboniferous series under the Severn, and so far
west as the level ridge of land, extending from
near Launceston to the sea coast between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Gennys and Botreaux Castle, along which plane
the escarpment manifests itself in a very conspicuous
manner.</p>

<p>While these discoveries may be considered as in
progress, a Cornish gentleman, but one whose
genius does honour to the nation, Mr. Robert Weare
Fox, has deduced from galvanic action on metals,
on their oxides, on their sulphurets, and on their
saline solutions in water, the only theory that has
yet accounted for the various phenomena observed
in metallic lodes; and extending still further his
investigations to the recently discovered connection
<!--025.png--><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi"></a><span class="pageno">xxi</span>
between electric energies and terrestrial magnetism,
Mr. Fox has been enabled to give more than
probable reasons for the extraordinary fact of some
metals usually selecting, in all parts of the world,
lodes or fissures running nearly east and west, and
why other metals prefer rents at right angles to the
former; and in respect to the fissures themselves,
Mr. Fox has remarked appearances inducing him
to believe that lodes of considerable breadth have
not been formed by any one great and sudden
rending of the earth; but that, in a manner similar
to the rising or to the sinking of land, by the gradual
action of causes now well known to exist,
those clefts have been enlarged from time to time,
and have as frequently received additional deposits,
easily discriminated from each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox appears also to have settled beyond the
possibility of doubt, the long-agitated question
respecting the temperature of mines, by establishing
a general relation between increases of heat
and depth; although the ratio cannot be reduced
to any definite formula, being liable to vary with
the presence of more or less water, and with the
different conducting power of rocks, since mines
in granite and in killas differ by several degrees of
heat at the same level: yet the increase corresponds
so generally with greater descents into the earth,
that elevation of temperature, and not the expense,
nor the difficulty of exhausting water, appears
likely to oppose the final limit to the progress of
mines in depth.</p>

<p>In continuation of the same trains of reasoning
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii"></a><span class="pageno">xxii</span>
and of thought, Mr. Fox has been led to investigate
the important elements of variation and dip of the
magnetic needle; and in pursuing these inquiries,
he has invented an instrument possessed of far
greater accuracy than any one previously employed,
and which at this moment is in actual use, through
the enlightened liberality of our own and other
governments, in various and distant portions of
the globe.</p>

<p>Mr. Henwood is about to lay before the Public
a Work containing the results of more extensive
and scientific researches into the nature of Lodes
and Fissures, than have perhaps been ever executed
by any individual. Mr. Henwood is well known to
geologists: I shall therefore only add what I think
myself bound in duty to notice, that an original
appointment in the Stanneries, and a subsequent
promotion, have been bestowed on Mr. Henwood,
through the medium of Her Majesty’s Duchy Officers,
and principally of Sir George Harrison, in
consideration of his scientific attainments, and of
his desire to render these attainments available to
the development of further inductions.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I have endeavoured to render the work cheap by
adopting the octavo form, and by abstaining from
all decoration, except a slight sketch of the Pitt
Diamond, which by raising that family into an
influential situation, has modified the fate of Europe
in a degree impossible to have been contemplated
<!--027.png--><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"></a><span class="pageno">xxiii</span>
by the Regent Duke of Orleans, when he
purchased that bauble at the expense of an
hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds; and
excepting also the Tomb of Archbishop Tregury,
a view of Cotehele house, and the Seal of a Corporation,
all of which had been previously cut
on wood. I have abstained from further expense
with the view of placing my work in the hands of
as many persons in Cornwall as I possibly could,
thereby diffusing the entertainment likely to arise
from Local Anecdotes, from Provincial Occurrences,
and from Historical Events, not of sufficient general
importance for securing to themselves a place
in national records. I have caused an ample
Index to be prepared for the whole work; and
among the Appendixes will be found an Index to
the Survey of our most respected historian Mr.
Carew; and I will add as a proof of my own disinterestedness,
that I have engaged to leave with
the Publishers all the profits, if any should arise,
reserving to myself the much more probable alternative
of sustaining the loss.</p>

<p>The concluding paragraph proves the least
agreeable of my work. I am sorry to say, that the
Typographical errors far exceed my expectation.
I must entreat of all my readers to excuse them,
and to correct the Text from the too extensive
Tables of Errata. The want of early habit, dimness
of sight, and absence from the Press, must be
alleged on my behalf; perhaps the compositor may
plead unusual names or terms, and subjects not
rendered familiar by his ordinary practice.</p>

<p class="center smaller h5head">TO</p>

<p class="center h3head">THE GEOLOGY OF CORNWALL.</p>

<p class="center h4head"><span class="sc">By Dr. BOASE.</span></p>

<hr class="mediumfr" />

<p><span class="sc">The</span> geological notices inserted in this Work,
are necessarily so brief and so unconnected, on
account of the alphabetical arrangement of the
parishes, that it is desirable that a few introductory
remarks should be made that this defect may
be in some measure obviated.</p>

<p>Cornwall does not possess a great variety of rock
formations, being composed of primary and transition
or intermediate groups, covered here and
there with deposits of gravel, sand, and clay,
which belong to the modern epoch. But this
limited range of formations is more than compensated
for by the great facilities which the geologist
here enjoys in his investigations; the very
extended line of cliffs which deeply indent the
Cornish shores proffer numerous and instructive
sections; and the vast mining operations have
brought to light most important phenomena. Indeed,
no country of equal extent can, in these combined
advantages, be compared with Cornwall.</p>

<p>On a general view of this country, the surface
exhibits two systems of valleys; one running parallel
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"></a><span class="pageno">xxvi</span>
with the central ridge, which is highest near
Launceston, and gradually, but irregularly, declines
till it terminates at the Land’s End, in cliffs
about a hundred feet in height; the other intersecting
the longitudinal valleys at right angles;
and as all the intermediate hills are more or less
rounded, the country has an undulating appearance
in both directions, not unaptly compared to
the waves of the sea. Through these two systems
of valleys, the rivers flow, seeking outlets into the
sea by the nearest continuous descent; sometimes
they effect this along the longitudinal, at others
through the transverse valleys, receiving tributary
streams on either hand from the lateral valleys,
or curved hollows which they intersect. But
sometimes the river is diverted in its course more
than once, in consequence of the concavity of a
cross curve rising above its level&mdash;or by that of
the other system descending below this point&mdash;by
which irregularity the stream is compelled to flow
along the more favourable drainage; thus the
Camel rises about four miles from the sea, in the
moors near Davidstow, and flows more than twenty-five
before it empties itself into the sea at Padstow.
In the hollows of these valleys the drainage is
often sufficiently obstructed to produce marshy
ground; but seldom of such extent as to deserve
the name of a lake.</p>

<p>As regards the soil, on the high grounds it is
frequently very shallow and barren; but in the valleys
it is very productive, and here and there is well
wooded, more particularly on the southern coast.
On the northern coast, in the vicinity of the sea,
<!--031.png--><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii"></a><span class="pageno">xxvii</span>
it is very sandy, owing to the light testaceous sand
of the shore being carried inland by high winds;
in this manner no inconsiderable tracts of fertile
land have been devastated.</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the internal
or geological structure of Cornwall. The highest
parts of the central ridge, already alluded to, are
composed of granite, which occurs in the form of
four large insulated patches, so disposed at nearly
equal distances from each other as to resemble a
chain of islands extending from Launceston to the
Land’s End, that is in the direction of N.E. and
S.W. On the same ridge, but rather parallel than
continuous thereto, is the great granitic group of
Dartmoor in Devon, the whole of which is sometimes
called the Ocrynian Range.</p>

<p>The granitic patch of Dartmoor is by far the
most extensive, being nearly twenty miles in diameter;
that of Launceston is ten miles in length
by six or seven in breadth at its widest part; and
its most elevated hills, Rough-tor and Brown-Willy,
do not much exceed 1,300 feet in height. The
granitic rocks of this patch, like that of Dartmoor,
are not much exposed by artificial excavations, so
that their varieties cannot be easily examined;
the <em>weathered</em> blocks, which on the summit and
sides of the hills form tors and detached masses,
consist of the hard or siliceous varieties of the
common and fine-grained granites, such as have
withstood the action of the elements. One of the
most curious of these tors is the <span class="title">Cheese Wring</span>,
near Liskeard, a pile of single blocks, each being
larger than the one immediately beneath. Proceeding
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii"></a><span class="pageno">xxviii</span>
along the ridge towards the Land’s End,
the next, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austel patch of granite will be
found, much less than the last, but more interesting
both in a scientific and a commercial point of
view. In addition to the kinds of granite already
noticed, it contains beds of talcose granite, or
protogine, which by its decomposition furnishes
that valuable substance <dfn>china clay</dfn> or <dfn>kaolin</dfn>, many
thousand tons of which are annually exported for
the potteries. The third, or Redruth patch of granite,
affords many varieties of this rock, and has
been well explored by numerous mines which have
been productive in both tin and copper ores,
affording also to the mineralogist a great variety
of rare specimens. But the fourth, or Land’s End
granite, is by far the most important to the geologist,
for the land becoming here very narrow, the
sea has produced cliff-sections, both in the granite,
and also at its point of junction with the slate, exhibiting
many interesting phenomena. Among
these, the veins of granite in the slate are beautifully
displayed, and have long been a great attraction
to geologists; but the modes in which these
rocks meet and unite, are not less deserving of
notice. But for a detailed description of these
curious facts, the reader may be referred to my
“Treatise on Primary Geology.”</p>

<p>Besides these four principal patches of granite,
there are four others: 1st. that of Kitt Hill, near
Callington; 2nd. that of Tregonning and Godolphin,
near Helston; <abbr title="third">3d</abbr>. that of Cligga Point, near
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes; and lastly, that of the celebrated <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s Mount. The two first are of some size,
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix"></a><span class="pageno">xxix</span>
and at the surface are both subdivided near the
middle, by the overlapping of the slate: the other
two are small, but very interesting to the geologist.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the fertility of these
granitic groups gradually increases as they diminish
in elevation; and it is a curious but not surprising
coincidence, that the number of parish
churches thereon follows the same order:&mdash;thus on
the eastern and most extensive tract of granite,
near Launceston, there is only one church; on
the next there are three; on the Redruth patch
six; and on the Land’s End granite no less than
nine, within a space considerably less than that of
the eastern tract.</p>

<p>Each of these insulated groups of granite is surrounded
by schistose rocks, the layers of which,
on all sides, incline from the granite at various
angles, from 20<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> to 40<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Although these groups
are thus separated from each other by the slate
at the surface, yet it is the general opinion that
they gradually approach beneath, until they are
all united into one and the same mass&mdash;the intermediate
hollow spaces (the valleys, as it were, between
the granitic mountains) being occupied by
the slate. It might, however, be maintained that
the granite is imbedded in the slate, in large
rounded masses, which would also account for the
former rock underlying the other, within the
limits of mining operations: and such an opinion
would derive some support from the fact, that
small insulated masses of granite in the slate are
not of unfrequent occurrence.</p>

<p><!--034.png--><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx"></a><span class="pageno">xxx</span>
The slate formation consists of two very distinct
groups, when the most characteristic rocks are
alone regarded; but it is not easy to trace the
boundary between them, as the contiguous rocks
appear to pass gradually into each other. These
groups have one character in common: <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that
they consist of several distinct kinds of rocks, each
genus of which respectively may be subdivided
into schistose and compact rocks; the latter are
imbedded in the former&mdash;are more crystalline&mdash;and
often contain clusters of their constituent
minerals: so that the complicated composition of
these rocks is made known by Nature’s own
analysis.</p>

<p>The group next the granite is <em>primary</em>, the more
remote one is <em>transition</em>, or as they are termed in
the following pages the <dfn>porphyritic</dfn> and <dfn>calcareous</dfn>
series of the slate formation. The series next the
granite is characterised by its beds of porphyry,
and by its abounding in veins of tin and copper
ores; the other series by the frequent occurrence
of calcareous spar and strata of limestone, with
occasional organic remains, and by its being sparingly
metalliferous, containing no tin-ore, but
being productive of lead and antimony. It is
within the last series that the magnesian or serpentine
rocks occur, and which in the Lizard district
are developed to a large extent, forming one
of the most interesting geological features of
Cornwall. Those who are desirous of more information
concerning this slate formation, will find
a copious account in the fourth volume of the
Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall.
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi"></a><span class="pageno">xxxi</span>
It is there proposed to give these rocks,
whenever they possess well-marked characters,
distinct names, and not to refer a great variety of
rocks to the vague and indefinite genera of clay-slate
and greywacké. An accurate and more extended
nomenclature would have rendered the following
notices much more intelligible.</p>

<p>In describing the general features of Cornwall,
we must not omit to mention the metalliferous
veins&mdash;the great source of its commercial prosperity&mdash;and
the channel through which much curious
information has been obtained, concerning
the structure of the earth. These veins traverse
indifferently both the granite and the slate, but
are most abundant in the latter rock, in the vicinity
of the granite. The general direction of the
tin and copper veins (or <dfn>lodes</dfn>, as they are provincially
called) is nearly E.N.E. and W.S.W., and they
are crossed by another system of veins, nearly at
right angles, which are not commonly metalliferous,
and when they do contain ores these are
often of lead, antimony, silver, and other metals.
This is not however a general rule, for in the parish
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, Penwith, the tin and copper ores
occur in the cross veins. The course of the veins
is not straight, but they are always more or less undulating,
both in their direction and in their dip or
underlie. Various interesting phenomena result
from their meeting with and intersecting each
other, known to the miner under the names of
<dfn>heaves</dfn>, <dfn>throws</dfn>, and <dfn>slides</dfn>. This subject is replete
with curious facts, but would require considerable
space for their enumeration; the reader must
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii"></a><span class="pageno">xxxii</span>
therefore be again referred to the work already
alluded to on “<dfn>Primary Geology</dfn>.”</p>

<p>Before concluding this brief sketch, a few words
must be said on the beds of clay, sand, and gravel
which cover the low grounds, both on the granite
and on the slate. These may be resolved into two
kinds: 1st. those resulting from the decomposition
of the rocks, and which are in their original position;
and <abbr title="second">2d</abbr>. those which are not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i>, affording
by their appearance, composition, and position,
evidence of their having been transported. These
deposits belong to three distinct periods, and alternate
with terrestrial and marine remains, according
to their situation in respect to the sea-level
at their respective epochs. Each of these
transports was accompanied, or followed by, a
change in the sea-level: the last corresponds with
that now existing; the previous one, by the elevated
ancient beaches, indicates that the sea was
about fifty feet above its present level; and the
earliest transport, being covered with sub-marine
forests, shows that the sea was at that epoch at
least fifty feet lower than it now is. (See 4th <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr>
Geol. Trans. of Cornwall, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 466, et seq.) In the
lowest or oldest deposit the tin-ore (<dfn>stream-tin</dfn>) is
found in the form of sand and gravel mixed with
earthy substances: it affords the purest kind of
tin, known in the market by the name of <dfn>grain-tin</dfn>;
and appears to be the source from which the
ancients derived all their tin. The notices under
each parish will furnish more particulars concerning
these interesting deposits.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WHITAKER.</p>

<p>Ridiculing the etymology of Advent suggested by
Hals, Mr. Whitaker says, “The appellation is merely
personal, and that of the church’s saint,” Adwen. This
was one of a numerous family of saints, whose history,
as they have left their names to several parishes and
churches in Cornwall, it may be desirable to detail in
this place, as it is quoted by Leland from the Life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Nectan, who was the eldest brother. “Brechan, a petty
king of Wales, from whom the district of Brocchanoc
(Brecknock) derived its name, had by his wife Gladwise
twenty-four sons and daughters, whose names were:
Nectan, John (or Ivan), Endelient, Menfre, Dilic;
Tedda, Maben, Wencu, Wensent; Merewenna, Wenna,
Juliana, Yse; Morwenna, Wymp, Wenheder, Cleder,
Keri; Jona, Kananc (or Lalant), Kerhender, <em>Adwen</em>,
Helie, Tamalanc. All these sons and daughters were
<!--041.png--><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pageno">3</span>
afterwards saints, martyrs, or confessors, leading the life
of hermits in Devon and Cornwall.” The same story is
related by Giraldus Cambrensis and William of Worcester.

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The eastern part of this parish consists of granite,
forming a portion of an extensive group of this rock,
in which are situated Roughtor and Brown Willy, the
highest hills in Cornwall. This granite is of the ordinary
kind, large grained, and often porphyritic. It
contains beds of fine-grained rocks, in some of which
crystalline felspar, quartz, and mica, constitute the
entire mass; but in others these minerals are embedded
in a basis of compact, or rather of granular felspar, which
is itself apparently a compound of felspar and quartz.
<!--042.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pageno">4</span>
The junction of the granite with slate is concealed
by a large track of marsh and bog; adjoining to which
is a dreary waste of common, resting on an irregular
bed of quartzose gravel, derived from the granite hills,
and evidently of diluvial origin. This eastern part
is sterile, merely affording a scanty subsistence to
cattle during the summer. The remainder of the parish
is composed of felspar and hornblend rocks, traversed
here and there by courses of granitic elvan, a rock in
every respect similar to that occurring in the granite.
One of these courses may be seen by the road side near
the rivulet of Pencarrow. Here the country is wooded
and cultivated, exhibiting some picturesque scenes of
hill and dale; so characteristic of the hornblend rock
near granite.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes is situate in the hundred of Pyder.</p>

<p>At the time of the Conqueror’s tax there was no
such parish or district as Saint Agnes; but the same
passed in rates under the jurisdiction of the Earl of
Cornwall’s manor, now Duchy, of Twarnhayle; together
with Peransand: which now parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes
was taxed to the four shillings in the pound land-tax,
9th William and Mary, 1696, 137<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 5<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>The present church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes was of old only a
small free chapel dedicated to her, without endowment,
till the same was augmented and rebuilt, of three roofs,
as it now stands, by charitable collections, and the proper
charge and cost of the inhabitants thereof, in 1484;
consecrated and dedicated to the honour of Almighty

God, in the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, as a daughter church

of Exon.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span>
</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes was a Roman by birth, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 285,
descended of noble ancestors, and being beautiful of
body and mind, at 13 years of age was courted in marriage
by the son of Sempronius, then governor of Rome;
but because he was no Christian she utterly refused his
address, who complained thereof to his father; that immediately
he sent for Agnes, and renewed the proposals
of marriage made to her by his son, making larger offers
for her advantage, which altogether proving ineffectual,
Sempronius asked her whether she would adore and
sacrifice to the Roman gods, and abandon the superstition
of the Christians, but she, proving constant to her
religion, utterly refused to do that also; whereupon she
was committed to prison, from thence, after much hard
durance, sent among persons of ill fame, where her innocence
and purity were miraculously preserved, till at
length, by the Governor’s order, she was committed to
the flames, which immediately parted asunder, and did her
no harm; whereupon the Governor, and Auspitius his
agent, commanded her to be taken out of the fire, and
forthwith to be beheaded by the common hangman, 20
January, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 304, in the latter end of the reign
of Dioclesian, or in the beginning of Constantius and
Galerius. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ambrose wrote her life. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Isidore, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine, Demetrius, and Prudentius, with Aloysy
Lessomanus, Bishop of Seville, have all written very
commendable things of her. In the glass windows of
this church I remember to have seen written the remains
of a broken inscription,&mdash;“in carcere serat Agnes,”&mdash;referring,
I suppose, to her sowing or preaching the Word
<!--044.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
in the prison, jail, or hold, to which she was confined
as aforesaid. The parish feast is holden on the Sunday
following <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Day.</p>

<p>In this parish stands Carne Bury-anacht, or Bury-anack,
synonymous words, only varied by the dialect;
id est, the still, quiet, spar-stone grave, or burying-place,
where, suitable to the name, on the natural, remote,
lofty circumstances thereof, stand three sparstone
tumuli, consisting of a vast number of those
stones, great and small, piled up together, in memory
of some one notable human creature before the 6th centuary
interred there.</p>

<p>This is that well-known place called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Ball,
that is to say, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ pestis, or plague, so named
from the hard, deep, and dangerous labour of the tinners
there, out of which mountain hath been digged up,
for at least 150 years’ space, about ten thousand pounds
worth of tin per annum; which keeps daily employed
about the same 1,000 persons, who for the most part
spend their time in hard and dangerous labours as aforesaid,
in order to get a poor livelihood for themselves and
families, in the pursuit of which, here and in other
places, many of those poor men yearly by sad accidents
lose their lives.</p>

<p>The natural circumstances of this Ball is a subject as
worthy the consideration of the most sage virtuosos, or
natural philosophers; for, though it be a stupendous
and amazing high mountain, abutting upon the Irish
sea, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Channel, rising pyramidally from
the same at least 90 fathom above the sea and contiguous
lands, yet on the top thereof, under those spar-stone
graves, or burying-places, is discovered by the tinners,
five foot deep, good arable land or earth; under that,
for six foot deep, is found a fine sort of white and yellow
clay, of which tobacco-pipes have been made;
beneath this clay is a laying of sea-sand and nice totty-stones.
Two or three hundred fathoms from the sea,
<!--045.png--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pageno">7</span>
and about eighty fathoms above it, under this sand, is to
be seen for about five foot deep, nothing but such totty-stones
as are usually washed on the sea-shore, and in
many of them grains of tin. Under those stones the
soil or matter of the earth, for five or six feet deep, is
nothing to be seen but <dfn>carne-tyer</dfn>, id est, spar-stone land
or earth, under which spar-stone earth appears the firm
rock, through which tin-loads are wrought or pursued
by the tinners fifty, sixty, and seventy fathoms deep.
This Ball, or lands containing this diversified matter or
soil, contains about eighty acres in circumference;
which amuseth most men how the earth, clay, sand,
totty-stones, or spar-stone land, should yet be so high
above the solid rocks to the top of this mountain, unless
Noah’s flood was universal, and reached to this
island, as the labouring tinners believe and tell us.
More sure I am, from ocular demonstration, that a
quantity of the white sort of sand in this Ball, or hill,
washed in a stream or river of clear water, will instantly
turn the same water into a milk-white colour, and not
to be discerned from milk, as long as you continue to
pour the said sand into the river; but this is to be understood
only of such clean white sand as is made use
of and prepared for writing sand-boxes.</p>

<p class="p2">The manor of Mithi-an, i. e. of whey, a notable
grange for cows and milk (otherwise, if the name be
compounded of my-thyan, Saxon, my servant or villain
by inheritance) was formerly the lands of Winslade
of Tregarick, in Flint, an hereditary esquire of the
white spur, who forfeited the same, with much other
lands, by attainder of treason, tempore Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>; so
that that King or Queen Mary gave those lands to Sir
Reginald Mohun, of Hall, knight, or his father, who
settled them upon his younger son, by which conveyance
it lineally descended to my very kind friend William
Mohun, of Tenervike, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now in possession thereof.

bequeathed this estate to his wife Sibella, (who was afterwards
married to John Derbyshire Birkhead, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>) and
his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Prowse. Sir Christopher Hawkins,
<abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>, who is the present proprietor of the whole,
bought it in 1777; one moiety of Mr. Birkhead, and the
other of Matthew Grylls, brother and heir of Robert
Grylls, who had purchased it in 1758 of the devisees of
Mrs. Prowse. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>This being the first parish in the hundred of Pider, I
take the opportunity of stating my opinion, that the
name clearly imports the fourth,&mdash;Perwith, Kesrier,
Powder, and Pider, all of which meet in one point, where
the four parishes of Redruth, Gwennap, Kenwyn, and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, actually touch; and the spot is called Kyvere
Ankou, the place of death, on account of the frequent
burial there of felones de se, or persons who have destroyed
themselves.</p>

<p>Trevannence I believe to mean the town in a valley
of springs. This barton has belonged to my family
upwards of five hundred years, so that we have used the
name de Trevannence, by customary inheritance of the
manor of Tywarnhails. But in 1559 Henry Earl of
Rutland, then Lord of the Manor, sold the fee of his
right in Trevannence to Richard Carne the younger,
of Camborne, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who reconveyed it the same year to
John Jeffry; and he conveyed it, in 1593, to Thomas
Tonkin.</p>

<p>[This estate was the property and the seat of Thomas
Tonkin, of Trevaunance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who made large
collections for a parochial History of Cornwall. Mr.
Tonkin enjoyed his estate but a few years; he died in
1742. His two sons, who did not long survive him, successively
inherited his estates, which, after their death,
were for a while in the possession of Thomas Heyes,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who married the daughter and heir of his son
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pageno">10</span>
James, but left no issue; the only child of his daughter,
who married Foss, having died unmarried, they descended
to the representatives of the three daughters of
Thomas Tonkin, who died in 1672; which daughters
had married into the families of Jago, Cornish, and Ley.
Mr. John Jago, and Mr. Hugh Ley, the immediate descendants
of two of the daughters, are now possessed of
two thirds of the manor of Trevaunance, and of such
portion of the manor of Lambourn as extends into this
parish, and was part of the Tonkin estate (except some
lands sold to J. Thomas, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Chiverton). The other
third part has been subdivided. Mr. Thomas has one
half of it by purchase, the other is divided between Mr.
Geach, a descendant of the family of Cornish, and Mr.
Paul Clerk.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span>
 Trevaunance House was taken down a few
years after the death of Mr. Tonkin; there is now a
cottage on its site. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>The above-named Richard Carne gave for his arms
(as appears by his seal) a pelican in her nest, with
wings displayed, feeding her young ones, which coat is
still to be seen in Trevannence seats, and in the roof of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ church. He was descended from the Carnes
of Glamorganshire, in Wales, who derive their pedigree
from Ithal, King of Gwent, whose direct ancestor was
Belimaur, the father of Cassibelan; which Carne settled
in Cornwall, as we have it by tradition, upon his ancestor’s
marriage with the heiress of Tresilian, of Tresilian
in the parish of Newlyn.</p>

<p>Westward of Breanis riseth with a gentle ascent the
great hill commonly called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Beacon; formerly
Carne Breanic. On the top are three stone barrows; to
the westward of the one now used for a beacon, are
visible remains of a small square fortification.</p>

<p>This parish is of a large extent, but for the most part
barren, with abundance of wortzel and downs; but
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
withal very populous, and not without some parcels of
very good land, particularly from Trevannence to Perwennack,
Tewan, Trevisick, Mewla, Meuthion; and
neither are the barren grounds the least considerable, as
producing large quantities of excellent tin, according to
the Cornish saying,</p>

<p>From the top of the first hill a part of Devonshire

<p>An attempt was made by the Tonkin family to form a
harbour at Trevaunance-Porth as early as the year
1632; it was attempted again in 1684, and, after a considerable
expence had been incurred, again given up.
In 1699, a third attempt was made with the assistance
of Mr. Winstanly, the celebrated engineer; the works
then constructed were destroyed by a violent storm in
1705. Mr. Tonkin, from whose notes this account was
taken, again commenced his works in 1710, at the expense
of £6,000; he formed the foundation with large
masses of rock laid in hot lime made of lyas stone from
Aberddaw, in South Wales. These works having become
decayed, a jetty pier of moorstone was built about the
year 1794, at the expense of £10,000, by a company of
gentlemen, and a considerable trade in coals, lime, slate,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> is now carried on with Ireland and Wales. The
proprietors are enlarging the harbour, and rendering it
<!--050.png--><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
more commodious and safe for shipping. A small stream
of water which rises in the manor of Tywarnhaile, turns
several stamping mills in Trevaunance Comb.</p>

<p>The market, for which there does not appear to be
any charter on record, has been held from time immemorial
for all sorts of wares and provisions, except corn.
In 1706, Mr. Tonkin procured the Queen’s patent for a
weekly market and two fairs; but after the writ of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad
quod damnum</i> had been duly executed, and the Queen’s
sign manual obtained, the grant was revoked in consequence
of a petition from the inhabitants of Truro. A
small market is nevertheless kept up; the market day is
Thursday.</p>

<p>In a dingle called Chapel-comb, was an ancient chapel
known by the name of Porth Chapel, the ruins of which
were taken down about the year 1780. Near this spot
is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ well, of which many miraculous stories are
told; the water is of an excellent quality, and much esteemed.
Hals speaks of an ancient free chapel in the
manor of Mythian, which had been made a dwelling
house. There are remains of an ancient chapel at Mola.
Nicholas Kent, of Mingoose, by his will bearing date
1688, gave for the term of 499 years a dwelling house,
divided into four tenements and a garden, for poor widows
of this parish, and charged his lands of Mingoose
and Tereardrene with the repairs of the house; but it
does not appear that it was endowed. One of the
schools, founded by the trustees of the fund left for charitable
uses by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Elliot, who died in
1760, is at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes; the endowment is £5 per annum.
There is a Sunday school at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes, supported by
subscription, and numerously attended.</p>

in a copy of the last Heraldic Survey, communicated to
the Editor by Mr. Gregor of Trewanthenick, although a
pedigree is alone recorded in the original. Sable, an

for difference. Crest, an eagle’s head erased Or. See the
exemplification of them by Robert Cooke, Clarenceux
Roy d’Armes, temp. Reg. Eliza.</p>

<p>The reason of the arms being then omitted was this:
Mr. Tonkin of Trevannence, the chief representative of
their family, was more than eighty years of age in 1620, a
bed-lier, and had been blind for many years, so that he
was not able to appear himself; and, the chief business of
the Heralds at their Visitations being to put money into
their own pockets, they never registered any arms without
their fees. The ancient motto used by this family is said
to have been:</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish is one of the great mining districts of
Cornwall, abounding in tin and copper ores, but more
particularly in the former. It differs, however, from all
the other districts, in being remote from the great central
masses of granite. This peculiarity has often attracted
the notice of several observers, and has long
been considered as a strange anomaly by geologists.</p>

<p><!--052.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
The case is not, however, without example; for, although
this tract is distant from the granite both of
Redruth and of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis, yet a small mass of that
rock does not exist at Cligga Point, on the confines of the
parish. This granite has, indeed, been called by some
an elvan, and by others a secondary formation of granite,
as has been also that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount; but, although
the rock is not in this place of any great extent, it
has all the mineralogical and geological characters of the
larger masses.</p>

<p>Large courses of granite elvan are common in the
northern part of the parish, containing short irregular
veins and bunches of tin ore. These courses are extensively
exposed in the cliffs, and present a singular appearance,
somewhat resembling a bank of earth perforated
by rabbits’ burrows, in consequence of the miners
having taken the ore wherever it has been exposed to
view.</p>

<p>The Beacon, a high hill near the church town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Agnes, merits particular attention. The lower part is
formed of a schistose rock, composed of granular felspar
intermixed with particles of quartz and minute scales of
mica. Ascending towards the summit, the quartz gradually
increases in quantity, till at last it becomes the
prevailing ingredient of the rock, and preserves it against
the natural causes of decay; whilst lower down, where the
felspar abounds, the rock is extensively disintegrated. On
the side of the hill, about three or four hundred feet above
the level of the sea, is a deep deposit of diluvium, consisting
of alternate layers of clay and sand. To point out the
origin of these layers, and to explain the reason of their
occurrence in such an elevated situation, would require
long details. For this, and for other interesting particulars
respecting the phenomena of this parish, the fourth
Volume of Transactions, published by the Geological
Society of Cornwall, may be consulted.</p>

<p><!--053.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pageno">15</span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Beacon was chosen as one of the principal
western stations in the great Trigonometrical Survey of
England. The position of the summit was then determined
with extreme accuracy: Latitude 50<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 18<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 27<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>,
Longitude 5<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 11<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 55<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>.7. In time 20 m. 47<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>.7. Height
above low water 621 feet. See the Philosophical Transactions

 It appears, however, by Mr. Tonkin’s notes, that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Agnes was deemed a
distinct parish, and had a parochial chapel in it, so early as the year 1396. A
licence to build a new chapel was dated <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1, 1482. <cite>Lysons.</cite></p>

 This gentleman was the lessee of the great mine before described. Borlase
says, “It is judged that the late Mr. Donnithorne, who had the whole
adventure, and worked it at his own expense, in a few years last past got at
least 40,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> clear by this mine, and much more he might have raised yearly

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen is situate in the hundred of Pow-dre-ham,
id est, the hundred of the old ancient county or province
town (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Lestwithell), for so it is called in the
first Duke of Cornwall’s charter 1336&mdash;now contracted
and corrupted to Powder Cantred.</p>

<p>At the time of the Norman Conquest this district of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen was taxed under the jurisdiction of Laner or
Lanher, i. e. templer; so called, for that long before
that time was extant upon that place a chapel or
temple dedicated to God in the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin of
Tours, the memory of which is still preserved in the
names of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s fields and woods, heretofore perhaps
the indowments of that chapel or temple; this
Laner is still the voke lands or capital messuage of the
Bishop of Exeter’s manor of Cargoll, whereunto it was
annexed; in which place of Lanher (formerly a wood or
forest of trees) the Bishops of Cornwall, and afterwards
the Bishops of Exon, had one of their mansion or
dwelling-houses for many ages,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>

Parr, from whom it passed by sale to Williams, and so
from Williams to Borlase, by whom this mansion or
barton of Laner was left to run to utter ruin and dilapidation,
having now nothing extant of houses but
old walls, stones, and rubbish. Out of this manor of
Lanher the Bishop of Exon endowed the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

and barton of Gwarnike, the old inheritance and dwellinge
of the once rich and famous family of the Bevills
for many generations; whose ancestor came out of Normandy
into England with William the Conqueror, and
was posted an officer at Truro under William Earl of
Morton and Cornwall (or Robert his father). Of his
posterity, tempore Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Sir Richard Bevill held
by the tenure of knight service 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr> in lands
and rents, and therefore was commanded by that king
to attend him, with a horse-trooper furnished cap-a-pee,

on his expedition into France, in the 25th year of his
reign. (Carew’s Survey of Cornwall.) John Bevill of this
place was sheriff of Cornwall 5 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Finally, the
name, blood, and estate of those Bevills terminated in
two daughters and heirs of John Bevill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sheriff of
Cornwall 16 <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> 1573, married to Grenville of Stowe,
and Arundell of Trerice, to whose younger son by Bevill’s
heir this barton and manor of Gwarnike was
given, but the said Mr. Arundell, commonly called the
Black Arundell by reason of his complexion, dying
without issue, gave those lands to his kinsman Mr. Prideaux,
of Fewburrow in Devon, whose heir sold the
same to Mr. Kempe, of Penryn, now in possession thereof.
Over the entry door of this house, in a stone or
piece of brass, is cut the arms of Bevill, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Ermine
a bull passant Sable, surmounted with an oak-tree Proper
or Vert; near which is this inscription likewise in
stone in Saxon-English letters:</p>

<p class="unindent center">Man, aboue all thinge<br />
Feare god and the kinge.</p>

<p>[In 1704 it was sold by the Prideaux family to Jamss
Kempe, of Penryn, and in 1731 purchased by Edward
Prideaux, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Place House, Padstow, ancestor to the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Charles Prideaux Brune, of the same place, who is
the present proprietor. There were formerly two chapels
at Gwarnike; one at a small distance from the house,
which was demolished before the year 1736, and another
attached to it, which, together with “the old hall, curiously
timbered with Irish oak,” was then remaining.
These old buildings were not long ago pulled down, and
a farm-house built on the site with the materials. Talgrogan,
in this manor, was some time the seat of a
younger branch of the Prideaux family. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>For the name of this parish (Allen), Alfred the Saxon
grammarian and Verstegan tell us that it is plain Saxon,
and is the common contraction of Alwyn, all-beloved,
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
or beloved of all, and for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen church must be construed
as the holy or consecrated church, beloved of all
Christians, which perhaps was the old name of that
little ancient chapel, now the minister’s chancel, to
which in after ages the present church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen was
annexed; however, let it be remembered also, that in
Armoric-Cornish, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Alan or Allen is holy breath or
respiration, or gift of speech.</p>

<p>Treon-ike, Saxon-Cornish, trees on the lake, or
spring leate, or bosom of waters, in this parish, is the
dwelling of James Borlase, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who married Hobbs,
and his father Cooke’s heir, by whom he had this place;
and giveth for his arms in a field Ermine, on a bend
Sable two hands issuing out of two clouds, or nebules,
tearing of a horseshoe in sunder Argent (see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn).
Otherwise, Tre-on-ike is the town or tenement situate
on the lake or river of water.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals here relates a story of some child being
missed by his parents and afterwards found; imputing
the temporary loss to supernatural agency, perhaps of
fairies, usually denominated in Cornwall “The Small
People, or Piskies.”]</p>

<p>From the inferior officers of this church, the sexton
and clerk, or sub-deacon tempore James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> have sprung
two notable rich and eminent families in those parts,
of justice of the peace and senators or parliamentary
degree; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Tregeagle and Vincent; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Vincent from
the clerk of Resheafe, and Tregeagle from the sexton of
Bosvallack, of whom more in their proper places; the
one burgess or member of Parliament for Truro, the
other for Mitchell, whose sons by ill conduct have
wasted and sold all their lands, tempore George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></p>

<p>In this parish, at Tretheris, is yet extant the walls
and ruins of an ancient free chapel and cemetery,
wherein heretofore God was duly worshipped, built perhaps
by the Bishops of Cornwall and Exon, when they
resided at Lanher aforesaid contiguous therewith.</p>

<!--057.png--><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pageno">19</span>
<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Partly in this parish is the great lordship of Gwairnick,
id est, the Hay River; a name not unsuitable to
the circumstances of the place, for a pleasant river
passeth through most fertile meadows beneath the house.</p>

<p>This place was the seat of the Bevill family, whose ancestor
came into England with the Norman Duke, and
was an officer under William Earl of Morton and Cornwall.
One of his posterity married a Gwairnick heiress,
and so it became the seat of the Bevills for about ten
descents; and then, for want of issue male, this lordship,
with other fair lands, descended to the two daughters of
the last gentleman of that name, who were married to
Grenville of Stow and to Arundell of Trerice.</p>

<p>The manor of Boswellick, which I take to signify the
house by the mill-river, upon the division of Bevill’s
estates between Grenville and Arundell, this fell to Grenville,
who sold it to Sir Richard Roberts, of Truro. This
gentleman, afterwards Lord Roberts, was in possession
of the estate towards the latter part of Queen Elizabeth’s
reign, for his son John Roberts, first Earl of Radnor,
was nursed here by Mrs. Tregeagle, the daughter of
Degory Polwhele, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and wife of John Tregeagle,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who held a lease of this estate from Sir Richard
Roberts. And this was the rise of the Tregeagles; for
John Tregeagle, their son, being foster-brother to the
said Earl, was afterwards by him made his chief steward,
and brought forwards in the world. [The heiress of
Tregeagle brought the lease to the Cleathers, who continued
to possess it for several generations. The manor
is now the property of John Thomas, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> Vice-Warden
of the Stannaries, by purchase from the representatives
of the Robartes family. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>Adjoining to this barton is Nancarrow; and this
being the first occasion for noticing the adjunct word
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pageno">20</span>
“carrow,” I shall be somewhat the more prolix in discussing
of it. Karo, or Caro, signifying in Cornish a
hart or deer, Nancarrow has generally been considered
to be the deer’s valley, and Pencarrow the
head of the deer; but how improperly let any
one guess who sees these places. I rather take Carrow
therefore to be softening of Karrog, a brook or
rivulet, so as to signify, in this instance, the valley of
brooks; and in Pencarrow, the head of the brooks.
Nancarrow was formerly inhabited by a family of
that name, one of whom was stannitor for Blackmore
in the Convocation of 13th Elizabeth. It passed by sale
to the Borlases of Treludra, and from them to the
Scawns. [It now belongs to Mr. Oliver Adams Carveth.
<cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>Adjoining to the barton of Gwerick, which means
simply “on the river,” is a tenement called the Gerras,
that is, “the summit or top,” from its high situation;
which I notice in this place on account of its lead mines.</p>

<p>Trerice in this parish belonged to a younger branch
of the Arundells of Trerice in Newlyn; from whom it is
said to have been wrested not very fairly, by an attorney,
Mr. John Coke. The estate now belongs to Lord Falmouth.</p>

<p>Near to Trerice is Trefronick, contracted, as I believe,
from Tre-vor-in-ick,&mdash;“the dwelling in the way to the
rivulet.” This also belonged to the Arundells; passed to
John Coke, from him to Borlase, and from Borlase to
Kempe.</p>

<p>Adjoining is Talcarne&mdash;“the high heap of rocks of
stones.” Tal properly signifies the forehead, and hence
any high or eminent thing; whereas Tol, often confounded
with it, means a hole.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">LYSONS.</p>

<p>The principal villages in this parish are Lane and
Zela or Zealla, through which the high road from

<p>For the modern name of this church, Mr. Carew, in
his Survey of Cornwall, is of opinion it is derived from
the Altar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun’s Pool in this parish, heretofore
much frequented for the cure of mad people, the manner
of which cure is set down by him, liber <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 123, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
289 of Lord Dunstanville’s edition,) but, for my own part,
I conceive the word Altar in this place is not to be construed
as a derivative from altare, an altar, whereon
offerings or sacrifice was made to God by fire or otherwise
at this pool; but rather, as I am better informed,
the chancel of the present church was a chapel pertaining
to the nuns or nunnery once here, afterwards
augmented and converted to a vicarage church as it now
stands; and that the ground whereon the vicarage house
is now extant. Contiguous therewith was of old the
nunnery-house itself, wherein those virgins resided;
the stones and materials of which old house are concerted
in the new vicarage brave mansion, and, to prove
this tradition, there yet appears in the fields the channel
or water-course wherein the waters of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun’s
Pool was carried into this old nunnery-house in former
ages.</p>

<p>So that I conclude the name Altar Nun must be
interpreted as a corruption of or derivative from Alter-Nun,

of a parochial and vicarage church, from whence the
same hath its present denomination, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>In this parish stands the barton of Tre-lawn-y, id
est, the oak grove town, or, “I am the oak grove
town,” a name at first given and taken from the natural
circumstances of the place, situate between two
hills, then notable for woods or groves of oak timber.
Though now there is not left standing any house or
trees to countenance this etymology, yet I have been
told by some of the inhabitants of this parish, that tradition
saith the greatest part of the stones that built the
present church and tower of Altar Nun, were brought
from the dilapidated walls of Trelawny, and much of
the oak timber that roofs the same was also cut and
carried from that barton.</p>

<p>From this place was denominated that old and famous
family of gentlemen surnamed Trelawney, now baronets,
as I was informed by my very kind friend Coll. John
Trelawney, of Trelawney, deceased, and that one Sir
William de Trelawney, lord of this place, suffered it to
go in marriage with his base daughter to &mdash;&mdash;, from
whose heirs, by descent or purchase, it came to Cloberry
Hickes, and &mdash;&mdash; now in possession thereof, and
is now set for about 70<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr> The arms of those
Trelawneys were, in a field Argent, a chevron Sable
between three oak-leaves Vert, probably in allusion to
the leaves of that sort of timber whereof this <em>lawne</em> consisted.</p>

<p>In this parish, tempore Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> lived Peter Jowle
or Joull, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, Peter the Divell, under clerk or deacon
of this church, who was 150 and odd years old when he
died, and at the age of 100 years had new black hairs
that sprung forth on his head amongst those that long
before were white with age; and then also new teeth
grew up in his jaws in the places of those that many
years before were fallen out of his head. [The name of
Joll is still extant in the village; and the family have
<!--062.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>
been remarkable for longevity; but we cannot learn that
any tradition exists relating to Peter Joll, nor does his
name appear in the register. <cite>Lysons.</cite>] Fuller tells us,
that John Sands, of Horborne in Staffordshire, lived 140
years old, and his wife 120, he died 1625. Thomas
Parr lived 153 years old, and is buried in Westminster
Abbey, tempore Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> It is reported of Zamkees,
the Samothracian, that after he had lived 104 years, new
young teeth sprung up in his jaws in the room of those
that were fallen out long before. Henry Brenton, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Wenn, weaver, lived 103 years old, and died tempore
George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>It is obvious to any one, that the name of this parish
can signify no other than an Altar or church dedicated
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nunne; which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nunne, being in some accounts
called Naunita or Nannites, and in others Novita, is
(as Leland tells us) said to have been the daughter of
an Earl of Cornwall, and mother of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, the famous
Archbishop of Menevia, from him called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
David’s.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun is stated to have been the mother of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David.
About a mile from the cathedral of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David’s are the
remains of a chapel, near a consecrated pool or well,
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun, where trifling oblations are said
to be still made. This coincidence of the two pools is
curious, although I do not find that the water at Menevia
has the virtue of curing insanity. The account
given by Mr. Carew of the practice at Altar Nun is as
follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The water running from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun’s well fell into a
square and inclosed walled plot, which might be filled
at what depth they listed. Upon this wall was the
frantic person set to stand, his back towards the pool;
<!--063.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
and from thence, with a sudden blow in the breast, tumbled
headlong into the pond; where a strong fellow,
provided for the nonce, took him, and tossed him up and
down, alongst and athwart the water, till the patient, by
foregoing his strength, had somewhat forgot his fury.
Then was he conveyed to the church and certain masses
sung over him; upon which handling, if his right wits
returned, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun had the thanks; but if there appeared
small amendment, he was bowssened again and again,
while there remained in him any hope of life or recovery.”</p>

<p>The second of March is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nun, and
said formerly to be observed throughout Wales, as was
the third to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lily, surnamed Gwas-Dewy, David’s
men.</p>

<p>This parish is the largest in Cornwall. It measures
12,770 statute acres. The principal villages are Tredawl,
Trethym, Treween, and Trewint. At Five-Lanes, in
this parish, are fairs for all sorts of cattle, on the Monday
week after June 24th, and the first Tuesday in November.
The tower of Alternon church, which is said
to be the highest in the county except Probus, was
much damaged by storms in 1791 and 1810.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The western and south-western parts of this extensive
parish are composed of granite and of hornblend rocks,
which surround the former, and recline upon them. This
portion is in every respect similar to the parish of Advent.
At Trewint a very fine compact felspar occurs, imbedded
in green stone; and proceeding eastward on the
<!--064.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
Launceston road, hornblend slate prevails, and affords a
very fertile soil. Descending the hill to Pellaphant,
masses of compact rock protrude from beneath the soil.
They are composed of compact felspar, aggregated with
lamellar hornblend, forming a kind of sienite. But the
most interesting object in this parish is to be found a
little to the north of this last place, on the side of the
hill sloping down to the river Inny. It is a magnesian
rock, and it is quarried for building-stones, yielding
large blocks, which are sufficiently soft at the time of
their being raised, to allow of their being cut through
by a common handsaw. A considerable quantity of
this stone has been used in building a very large house,
denominated a cottage by the Duke of Bedford, at Ensleigh,
on the eastern bank of the Tamma. The stone
appears, however, to have one bad quality: the surface,
after a slight disintegration from exposure to the atmosphere,
becomes covered over with ocherous spots, owing
to the presence of a scaly mineral resembling diallage,
which is disseminated through the rock. This
magnesian rock has all the characters of pitstones,
the lapis ollaris of the ancients; and it is a curious circumstance,
that on opening some old workings near this
place, several antique vessels were found resembling
pipkins and shallow pans made out of this material.</p>

<p>The immediate connection of this bed of ollareous
serpentine with the adjacent rocks, is not disclosed; but
it is succeeded by talc ore, slate, and limestone, on the
other side of the river.</p>

charged as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, neither therein had
any church in Cornwall the appellation of Saint
given to it, except <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wene or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wena. But
this district was then taxed under the jurisdiction of
Treligan or Tregeare, and obtained not the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Anthony till the year of our Lord 1124, at which time
William Warlewast, Bishop of Exon, founded here a
church, and dedicated it to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, having before
dissolved the dean and four prebendaries in the
collegiate church founded at Plympton in Devon by the
Saxon kings, and in the room thereof erected a priory
of Black Canons (and dedicated the same to the Virgin
Mary): who also in this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony erected
a priory or cell of two Black Canons, canons regular
or Augustines, under the same tutelar guardian as its
superior, so called from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, Bishop of
Hippo in Africa, who died in the 4th century, and
was institutor of their <a name="rule" id="rule"></a>rule; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> 1. to live in common as
the Apostles did, on the stock revenues or endowment
of their church. 2. That all such as received baptism
should for several days wear a white garment in token
of their new birth. 3. That all priests should wear a
black cassock over their white garment, as himself did;
such afterwards became the habit of his order, whether
collegiate or hermits. 5. Over their sculls he appointed
a hood or scapular of the same black cloth as their
cloaks, and the hair of their heads to be worn at full
length, whereas the monks were always shaved. 6. He
gave a liturgy or rule to be observed by those of his
order in time of divine service (whereas before every
one in a monastery served God, prayed, and fasted, as
they best liked). 7. To live single persons, without marriage.
This Priory was called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Vall or de
Valle, to distinguish it from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Plym in
Devon, so named from the rivers on which they are
situate. This priory, together with its superior’s

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony’s name is derived from ανθος (anthos) flos,
a flower; and for his person, he was a native of Egypt,
about the yeare of our Lord 253: a most strict and
severe Christian, that lived a retired and hermetical
and begging life in the deserts thereof.</p>

<p>Plase, Place, id est, in Cornish a palace, was heretofore
the mansion and dwelling of the prior and his two
black canons, erected here as aforesaid. This house
and barton is now in possession of Arthur George Sprye,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Bullock; his father Martyn; his grandfather
Heale, his great-grandfather, of Blisland, attorney-at-law,
married &mdash;&mdash;. He gives for his arms,
in a field Azure, two bars and in chief a chevron Or.
The name Spry, Sprey, Spray, is Cornish, and signifies
a sprout, branch, sprig, twig, split, or slip of any
matter or thing. The name Spye I take it is local,
from some place called Spye in Devon.</p>

<p>This promontory of land, commonly called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony
point, which on the east side boundeth Falmouth
harbour from the British Ocean, not only from the name
of the priory here <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Vall aforesaid, but from
the natural circumstances of the place, I take to be the
Valuba or Valubia of Ptolemy, which consisteth of a
compound of two British words Val and Ubia, which
signifies the Vale point or promontory, or the point or
promontory of land that bounds or terminates the
river Val as aforesaid. Note also, that in British
Cornish, B, V, and F, are letters indifferently used one
<!--067.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pageno">29</span>
for the other; so that Falubia and Valubia are synonymous
words. Otherwise, Val-eba is the ebbing or reflux
of the river Val.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>In this parish lies the manor of Bohurtha, or Boswartha.
The higher house or dwelling under Boswartha,
is situated on a small creek of a sea, a small place called
Porth: this belongs to the family of Spry. The land immediately
beyond it, being covered with sand, is known
by the name of Tower, which is common to all like
places along the coast.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals states <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, the hermit of Egypt, to
be the patron Saint of this parish, and of the other two
known by the same name. This <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony is the reputed
founder of the ascetic Anchorites, from whose
assemblies in after times, monks, and subsequently
friars, or begging monks, derive their origin. He is
said to have lived from the year 251 to the year 356; to
have been the friend of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Athanasius, and to have held
some correspondence with Emperor Constantine. But
as the two western <a name="err2" id="err2"></a>points form part of the sea coast,
and the third is situated on a navigable river, it seems
to be most probable that they are all dedicated to the
more popular Saint in modern times, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony of
Padua, the universal patron of fishermen.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony was a native of Lusitania, having
been born at Lisbon in 1195, and christened Ferdinand,
which name he laid aside for that of Anthony, in honour
of the Egyptian hermit, on his entering into the order of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis. His long residence at Padua is said to have
procured for him the cognomen of that place, but the
addition of Padua is much more likely to have derived
its origin from the locality of his legendary miracle.
Actuated by the spirit of fanaticism common in those
times, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony endeavoured to conceal and to render
useless all the learning and all the powers of eloquence
<!--068.png--><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pageno">30</span>
which he had previously acquired as a canon
regular of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin at Lisbon, and during a residence
of eight years with the same order at Coimbra. Having
become a friar, he employed himself as a menial in the
kitchen, or in sweeping the cells, till an accident discovered
to the superiors the value and importance of
their newly acquired brother. The intelligence was conveyed
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, the renowned founder of the Friars
Minors, from whom a letter to our Saint is preserved:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“To my most dear brother Anthony, Friar Francis
wisheth health in Jesus Christ. It seemeth good to me,
that you should read sacred Theology to the friars; yet
so that you do not prejudice yourself by too great earnestness
in studies; and be careful that you do not extinguish
in yourself or in them the spirit of holy prayer.”</p>

<p>All the accounts remaining of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony agree in
representing him to posterity as an example of learning,
of piety, and of zeal. These qualities, possessed however
in common with thousands of others, would have
failed to make his name known to after times, if a legend
had not established his fame as a Saint, and elevated
him to the high station of protector and patron of fishermen
all over the Christian world.</p>

<p>The legend may be best conveyed in the poetry of
Dr. Darwin:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">So when the Saint from Padua’s graceless land,</div>
  <div class="i0">In silent anguish sought the barren strand,</div>
  <div class="i0">High on the shatter’d beach sublime he stood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still’d with his waving arm the babbling flood;</div>
  <div class="i0">“To man’s dull ear,” he cry’d, “I call in vain,</div>
  <div class="i0">Hear me, ye scaly tenants of the main!”</div>
  <div class="i0">Misshapen seals approach in circling flocks,</div>
  <div class="i0">In dusky mail the tortoise climbs the rocks,</div>
  <div class="i0">Torpedoes, sharks, rays, turbots, dolphins, pour</div>
  <div class="i0">Their twinkling squadrons round the glittering shore;</div>
  <div class="i0">With tangled fins, behind, huge phocæ glide,</div>
  <div class="i0">And whales, and grampi swell the distant tide.</div>
  <div class="i0">Then kneel’d the hoary Seer, to Heaven address’d</div>
  <div class="i0">His fiery eyes, and smote his sounding breast,</div>
  <div class="i0">“Bless ye the Lord!” with thundering voice he cry’d;</div>
  <div class="i0">“Bless ye the Lord!” the bending shores reply’d;</div>
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
  <div class="i0">The winds and waters caught the sacred word,</div>
  <div class="i0">And mingling echoes shouted, “Bless the Lord!”</div>
  <div class="i0">The listening shoals the quick contagion feel,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pant on the floods, inebriate with their zeal,</div>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony is situated in the calcareous group of the
slate formation, and is composed of a glossy blue and fine
grained slate, which alternates with a coarse blue rock
abounding in scales of mica, and is more or less lamellar
according to its proportion of this mineral: this compact
rock readily disintegrates, assuming various yellowish
tints, and an arenaceous appearance; indeed, it is
seldom seen but in that condition, and it has therefore
been sometimes mistaken by geologists for a variety of
sand-stone.</p>

<p>At Porth there is a narrow neck of land, on the upper
part of which lies a sandbank abounding in perfect shells,
which are arranged in layers, and appear similar to those
of the adjacent beach. This bank is at least thirty
<!--070.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
feet above high water-mark, and it is covered with a
stratum of earth in cultivation. The sand is silicious,
and becomes in the lower part intermixed with pebbles,
resembling in this respect the banks on the shores of
Mount’s Bay. This affords an example of an ancient
beach elevated above the one now in existence. The
whole coast of Cornwall furnishes numerous instances
of this occurrence, and the former beach is uniformly
at the same elevation above that actually in existence,
indicating that the sea must, at some former period, have
joined the land at a line now higher than the present
beach by that difference.</p>

and by that name to sit in Parliament <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
as a Baron), the gentlemen ever since, and him
now in possession of this lordship, are lineally descended.
The said Alexander Carew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff

was Sheriff of Cornwall 6th Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> His grandson,
Richard Carew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> author of the Survey of Cornwall,
was Sheriff thereof the 24th of Elizabeth; whose son,
Richard Carew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was, by letters patents bearing
date the 9th of August, 17th Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1641, created
the 278th Baronet of England; whose son or brother,
Sir Alexander Carew, was executed for pretended treason
against the Parliament of England, about endeavouring
to deliver up to Kinge Charles the Island of Plymouth,
whereof he was Governor, <abbr title="twenty-third December">23d Dec.</abbr> 1644. His
son, Sir John Carew, Baronet, was one of the Shire
Knights of this County 1660, who died about the year
1686, and left issue by &mdash;&mdash;, daughter of Sir William
<!--072.png--><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
Morrice, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> Sir Richard Carew, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and William
his brother.</p>

<p>Mr. John Carew, son or brother of Sir Alexander last
mentioned, was executed as one of the Regicides of
King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1661. Mr. Carew, in his Survey of
Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 180 of Lord Dunstanville’s edition,)
tells us that his first ancestor came out of France with
William the Conqueror, by the name of Karrow. In
the same book, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103, (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 246 of Lord Dunstanville,)
he said that Carew, of ancient Carru, was, and Carrue is,
a plough in French; but then it should have been written
Carue, or Charoue; and to countenance this opinion
of this family’s French descent, Camden, in his Remains,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143, tells us that the same holds by tradition,
I know not how truly, that Adam, or rather Arnold de
Montgomery, marrying the daughter of Carew of
Molesford, her son, relinquishing his own name, left
to his posterity his mother’s name, Carew, from whome
the Carews of Surrey, Devon, and Cornwall, are descended.
Contrary to this opinion, Prince, in his
Worthies of Devon, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 148, saith that Walter de
Windsor, about the time of the Norman Conquest,
a Norman Frenchman, (as some say Governor, Castellan,
Constable, or Steward of Windsor Castle, son of
that Otho, that came in with William the Conqueror,)
had issue William and Gerald his sons, who styled themselves
after the mode of that age, William and Gerald of
Windsor from the places of their residence, or for that
they were born there; from William, the Lord Windsor
is descended, and from Gerald, the Fitz-Geralds
Earls of Kildare, and the Carews of England. Gerald
of Windsor was Steward or Castellan of the Castle of
Pembrook, of Carew, in Wales, upon whom King
Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> bestowed Molesford, in Berkshire; he married
Nesta, daughter of Rosse, Prince of South Wales, to
whom the said King gave the Castle of Carew in those
parts; Gerald had issue by Nesta, Otho de Windsor,
<!--073.png--><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
who had issue William de Windsor or Carew, to whom
King John, by deed dated 1212, made a further grant of
Molesford, reciting the former deed of King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> to
his grandfather. So that this William was the first of
this family that assumed the name of Carew. Thus
Prince again, the author of the Antiquities of Oxford,
is positive that this family of Carew was denominated
from Castle Carew, in Pembrokeshire, and not otherwise.
Thus God in his providence, to check our presumptious
inquisitions and pretensions, hath wrapped all things in
uncertainty, bars us from long antiquity, and bounds
our search within the compass of some few ages, scarcely
affording any true record of pedigrees or descents as far
back as the Norman Conquest, whatsoever to the contrary
is by some men and families pretended.</p>

<p>Lastly, as this family was denominated from one of
their ancestors being Constable or Castellan of the
Castle of Carew, in Pembrokeshire, for carew doth not
signify a plough in British, for ardar, aradr, arar, is a
plough in Welsh, Cornish, and Armoric, and kaer, caer,
is a castle or fortified place. Carew, caer-ew, care-eff,
is he, his, or her, Castle, as ipie, ipea, ipeum. See
Ffloyd. Caer-eau, British Saxon, is a castle or fortified
place of water, referring perhaps to the medical or
purgative waters there.</p>

<p>As Mr. Carew saith his family was denominated from
one Carrow or Karrow that came into England with
William the Conqueror, so I must tell you that there
was in Cornwall and Devon, not long since, a genteel
family surnamed Carrow (id est, deer) who gave for
their armes, as appears from Nich. Upton’s Latin manuscript
book of Heraldry, before printing was invented,
now in my custody, dated 1444, in those words, “Monsieur
Joh’is de Carrow, port d’or iii lyons passant sable,”
which is now the arms of those gentlemen before-mentioned,
named Carew. Care-w, after the English Cornish,
is he, his, or her care, watchfulness, or circumspection.</p>

<p><!--074.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
In this parish or manor, as I take it, stands Intsworth,
alias Inis-worth, synonymous words signifying an island
of worth, price, or value, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a peninsular formed by
rivers of water, which leaves between them an angled
or three-cornered promontory of land, called in British
inis, signifying the same as amnicus mediamnis in Latin.
See Gluvias. This place, before the Norman Conquest,
was the land of Condura and Cradock, Earls of
Cornwall, by one of whose daughters or granddaughters,
Agnes, it came by marriage to Reginald Fitz-Harry,
base son of King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by Anne Corbet; who, in
her right, long after William Earl of Cornwall, of the
Norman race, forfeited the same to the King by attainder
of treason, was made Earl thereof, from whose
heirs it passed to the Dunstanvills and Valletorts; and by
Valletort’s daughter Joan, the widow of Sir Alexander
Oakston, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> who turned concubine to Richard Earl
of Cornwall, King of the Romans, who had by her a
sole daughter named Joan, married to Richard Champernowne,
a second &mdash;&mdash; Champernowne,
of Clift Champernowne, in Devon, in whose posterity
it remained till Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>’s days, when, his issue
male failing, his three daughters and heirs were married
to Monk, Fortescue, and Trevillian, from some of
whose heirs it came by purchase to Edward Nosworthy,
Esquire, Member of Parliament for Saltash, son of Edward
Nosworthy, merchant and shopkeeper in Truro,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> who married Hill of that place, as his
son aforesaid did Maynard and Jennings. The arms
of Nosworthy are (see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s by Saltash). The
name Nos-worthy signifies a “night of worth,” price
or value so called, for that the first propagater thereof
was born by night, or was notable for some profitable fact
done at that season. And John Nosworthy was steward
of Exon 1521.</p>

<p>East Anthony. Mr. Carew hath given a full account
how this manor came to his family (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 244 of Lord Dunstanville’s
edition); I shall therefore only take notice here
that the present Lord of East Anthony, so called in respect
of its situation from the church, is Sir William
Carew, a gentleman that in every respect comes up to
the merits of the greatest of his ancestors. He married
the Lady Anne Coventry, only daughter and heir of Gilbert
Earl of Coventry, by whom he hath one son, Coventry
Carew, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> He had also a daughter, Anne, who
died in the bloom of her age. Sir William Carew hath
lately built a stately house here of Penteran stone; and
hath adorned it with gardens, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> suitable to it. From
the bowling-green above the house is a beautiful prospect
of the river, and of all the country round.</p>

<p>Thanks, in this parish; perhaps from Angosa conspectus,
sight through Angosa, the sight or view as
lying open to the river. This was formerly the seat of
a family, Searle, who gave for their arms, Argent, a

the same group of rocks as those found in the
western <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, although the two parishes are so
remote from each other, and separated by such ranges
of hills. The slate is, however, more coarse and argillaceous
in this parish, and the massive rocks imbedded
therein are more compact, and almost entirely quartzose.
The whole formation is evidently more remote from the
granite.</p>

<p>By this church is a small promontory of land running
out into the sea, which, from its resemblance to Pendinas,
is called the Little Dinas. It was formerly fortified, and
had some guns planted upon it to secure the entrance
of Hailford harbour, which not being very broad it well
may command. And in time of wars, it were very convenient
there should be still some guns there, for the
safety of the ships that trade to and again in this harbour,
which, as the case now stands, may be easily
carried off by privateers. Thus much may be said for

<p>Merther in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, bordering on the sea, and joining

<p>[Mr. Hals exhibits the strong feelings of his time in
the story of Laa, when he says,]</p>

<p>At the time of the unhappy Rebellion, when the Lord
Hopton had disbanded his army, some of Fairfax’s
forces entered the house at Merther, threatening to murder
Mrs. Laa and the family, for being too dilatory in
dressing meat for them. Mr. Laa, then riding about his
<!--083.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pageno">45</span>
estate, had intimation that the rebels were in his parlour,
carousing at the expense of his bacon, poultry, and
strong beer. He with all possible expedition alighted
at the door, enters the kitchen, which is opposite to the
parlour, and being warmed with an honest zeal for his
King, took down a loaded gun from the chimney-piece,
and shot one of the rebels, who was at the head of the
table, dead on the spot. Immediately he took horse,
and rode towards the <a name="err3" id="err3"></a>Perr, and preserved his life from
the vile pursuers, being providentially well mounted, by
leaping a five-barred gate, and swimming across the
<a name="err4" id="err4"></a>Perr, it being at that time high water.</p>

<p>In the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell liveth Henry Hawkins,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney at law (younger brother of Mr. Hawkins
of Creed), who by his judgment, skill, care, and pains,
in his calling hath exalted his fame and estate to a
great degree. He married Scobell, and giveth for his
arms, Argent, on a saltire Sable, five fleur de lis.
His two sons by Scobell died without issue, and his
daughters were married to Hoblyn, Moyle, Hext, and
Hawkins, of Helston; and the youngest of that sex, with
all his lands and riches, was married to Tremayne, of

<p>The manor of Tow-ing-ton, alias Taw-ing-ton aforesaid,
taxed in the Domesday Book, 1087, is invested
with the jurisdiction of a court leet; and signifies “silence
in town,” or “extraordinary silence in town,” <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> when
that court sitteth; which was afterwards by King Edward
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> 1336, concerted or fixed into the Duchy of
Cornwall, by charter (see Lestwithell), with its appurtenances.</p>

<p>In this parish was born Jonathan Upcott, son of
George Upcott, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> by Mrs. May, of High Cross,
Ranger of the Parks to John Lord Robartes in Cornwall,
as also in Ireland, when he was Lord Deputy there.
This gentleman, having risen through various steps in
the army, during the reigns of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
<!--084.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
and William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> commanded a company in Flanders in
the great war against France under Lewis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV</abbr>. At
last, being ordered to take part in a desperate assault
on the French at Enghein, where the Dutch and Spanish
soldiers had proved better men at their heels than at
their hands, he bravely lost his life, together with the
greater part of his men.</p>

<p>King William is said in the course of this war to
have grown prodigal of Englishmen’s valour, blood, and
lives, as he had before been of their money; for when
any dangerous fort was to be attempted, which the
Dutch and Spanish soldiers refused, he commanded the
English to perform it, who, being led away by the vanity
of being accounted valiant soldiers, and for the honour
of the English nation, quickly undertook such direful
posts, though to their own destruction.</p>

<p>The manor of Tewynton, alias Tewington, takes its
name from the chief place, Tewor, which, though it
generally means “heaps of sand,” cannot be so interpreted
here; and much less applicable is the etymology
<!--085.png--><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>
given by Mr. Hals, of “silence in town,” but Tewor
means a hillock generally, so that Tewynton means, in
the mixed derivation common in Cornwall from British
and Saxon, “the town on a small hill.” This place was
the seat of the Sowles before they removed to Penrice,
and affords a quarry of excellent stone.</p>

<p><a name="err5" id="err5"></a>Pentwan, the “head of the hillocks of sand.” Lower
<a name="err6" id="err6"></a>Pentwan is situated at the mouth of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell river,
which would form a pretty little port, were it not for the
bar of sand made by the waste brought down from the
tin-works, so that small craft only can get in, and that
at spring-tides. It is a handsome village, and in good
seasons great stores of fish are brought in here.</p>

<p>In Henry the Eighth’s reign, Leland described <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Austell as a poor village, nor is it mentioned as a place
of any consequence either by Carew or Norden. It
first rose into consequence from its vicinity to Polgooth
and other considerable mines: it is now a considerable
thoroughfare; the great road from Plymouth to the
Land’s End was brought through it about the year
1760. The export of china clay, the decomposed or
never consolidated felspar, to all the great manufactories
of earthenware throughout England, affords employment
to industry and to capital, in a manner more
steady, and therefore more permanently beneficial, than
can ever be produced by the working of mines.</p>

<p>To facilitate their commerce, and generally to improve
the whole district, a harbour was constructed at
Seaforth about forty years ago by Mr. Charles Rashleigh;
<!--086.png--><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
a gentleman who will long be remembered, as
uniting strong abilities with energy of mind, and liberality
as well of practice as of sentiment. His name is
perpetuated in the port and in the buildings surrounding
it, which have received by public acclamation the
appropriate distinction of Charlestown. [The spot
was formerly called Porthmear, and was too inconsiderable
to be mentioned in Martyn’s map. In 1790 it contained
only nine inhabitants. In consequence of the
commodious harbour, the docks, and shipwrights’ yards,
and the pilchard fishery established by Mr. Rashleigh,
it has gradually increased to be a large village. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>More recent inventions have suggested an iron railway
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell along the descending vale to a new
harbour at <a name="err7" id="err7"></a>Puntner, The works are just now completed
(1832), and they promise to add still greater facilities to
commerce than those at Charlestown.</p>

<p>The other principal villages in this parish are Carvath,
Corbean, Pentewan or Pentuan, Porthpean, Rescorla,
Tregonissy, Tregorick, Trenarren, and Trethergy.</p>

<p>The church and town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell are well worthy of
notice. The church is much decorated on its exterior
surface of freestone by figures and scrolls worked on the
stone; and over the south porch is an ancient inscription,
<span class="muchsmaller">KYCH INRI</span>, never explained (engraved in Lysons,
<abbr title="page 232">p. ccxxxii</abbr>). The tower, although not so lofty as that
at Probus, is perhaps more elegant in its form and
proportion. The inside of the church presents a light
and pleasing appearance, in consequence of the large
space occupied by the windows.</p>

<p>The font is in the form of a bowl, carved with rude
monsters, standing on a round column, and supported
by four small pillars, which have monks’ heads for their
capitals. It is engraved in Lysons, <abbr title="page 233">p. ccxxxiii.</abbr></p>

<p>An almshouse, with six apartments for poor persons,
was erected in 1809.</p>

were found, together with a coin of Burgred king of
Mercia (expelled from his dominions in 874), in a
stream-work in this parish, in the year 1774. They
were deposited in a silver cup, which has since been
used for the sacramental wine at the church; and therefore

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish, so important in an economical point
of view, on account of its minal production, affords
a vast fund of geological information. Its northern
part is composed of granite; its southern part
of various rocks belonging to the porphyritic group.
Its granite on the eastern side is like that of Alternun,
and contains layers which abound in porphyritic crystals
of felspar. On the western side it comprises several
kinds of this rock; some characterised by the proportions
of shorl that enter into their composition; and others
by containing talc instead of mica, and by the felspar
being prone to an extensive decay, in which state it furnishes
porcelain clay (or china clay) for the potteries.
A more particular description of these kinds of granite
<!--088.png--><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
will be given hereafter, in the accounts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s,
and of the adjacent parishes. Carclaze tin mine must
not, however, be passed by, as it is one of the greatest
curiosities in Cornwall. This mine is worked “open to
the day” (according to the miners’ term), that is, like
a quarry. It is of a considerable depth; and its superficies
exceeds several acres in extent. It is excavated
entirely in a white granite, somewhat similar to the disintegrating
variety above alluded to; and when the sun
shines, the reflection of light is so exceedingly dazzling
as to be almost insupportable. The tin ore occurs here
intermixed with shorl and quartz, in the form of short
irregular veins, which traverse the granite in every
direction, and so abundant, that the whole rock requires
to be pounded and washed to complete an entire separation
of the ore.</p>

<p>Hornblend rocks succeed the granite, and produce a
red fertile soil. These extend a little to the south of the
town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, and are followed by a blue lamelar
slate, in which the mines are situated. This rock is
much softer, and more argillaceous than the hornblend
slate, and decomposes into a light-coloured soil. The
matrix of its lodes abound in chlorite: it is probably
a chlorite schist. This formation is traversed by several
beds of felspar, porphyry (elvan courses), in the western
side of the parish, which run north-east and south-west,
in a somewhat tortuous manner, and dip towards the granite.
One of these elvans, near Pentewan, has been extensively
quarried, and is much esteemed as a building
material. This chlorite slate also contains, in the cove
at Duporth, a bed of compact magnesian rock, abounding
in asbestos; and passes on either hand into the surrounding
slate, by means of layers of talcous schist.</p>

<p>This parish has long been celebrated for its stream
works, which are diluvial beds containing tin ore. They
are generally found in deep vallies where rivulets flow,
which are used in separating the tin ore, by its inferior
<!--089.png--><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pageno">51</span>
specific gravity, from common stones or pebbles; hence
the name of “stream-works.” The nature of these deposits
varies according to the positions which they occupy
between the sea and the granite; whence the stanniferous
strata were derived.</p>

<p>Pentewan stream-work is one of the most interesting
in the whole county. Its lowest bed consists of pebbles,
gravel, and tin ore, and it rests on the solid rock. Immediately
above this tin-ground is a black stratum of vegetable
remains, among which are stumps of trees, standing
erect, with their roots penetrating downwards into
the bed of gravel. This subterranean forest stands forty-eight
feet below high-water mark; showing that there
must have been a change in the relative sea level. On
this vegetable bed reposes a thick stratum of silt, intermixed
with horns of deer, and with other relics of
land animals, and also with detached pieces of timber.
This silt is of the same description as that now forming
in the Truro river, and in other estuaries on the coast;
and it contains layers of shells peculiar to such situations.</p>

<p>This silt is covered by a deep deposit of siliceous sand,
in which occur various remains, principally of marine
origin; and lastly, over this lies another bed of silt like
the preceding, which reaches to the surface, where a
thin marsh soil is now in a state of cultivation. The
upper bed of silt is nearly on a level with the sea, being
separated and protected from it by the interposition of
a sandy beach.</p>

<p>Many theoretical observations and reflections would
naturally present themselves, after a statement of these
facts; but such would be more appropriate to a separate
treatise, than to a series of notices on individual parishes.</p>

charter of Queen Elizabeth, are assigned to the relief and maintenance of the
poor.</p>

British Channel; north, Luxulion; west, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell. At
the time of the Norman Conquest this district was rated
either under Tywardreth, Towington, Trenance, or Treverbyn.
In the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln
and Winchester, 1294, before mentioned, Ecclesia de

de Powdre, this parish was taxed to the Pope’s

<p>Quæry, whether the word fanum be not, by the scribe,
a corruption of Foy-town? In the inquisition aforesaid,
however, let it be remembered that, Ecclesia de
Fanum must be interpreted as the church or temple, consecrated
to divine service, appropriated to the house of
Tywardreth, as both those churches of Fowey and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Blazey are. As for the tutelar guardian from whom
the same and the parish is denominated, Blaze, he was
born in Sebaste, a city of Cappadocia in Asia, whereof
he was bishop, and governed his church so well, that
the priests of the idols (then worshipped comparatively
all the world over,) took distaste at him for his preachments
against idolatry; and exhibited a complaint
against him to Agricolaus, the emperor Dioclesian’s
president in those parts, by whom he was examined as
to this and other parts of Christian religion; which he
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
would not retract; wherefore he was by him committed to
prison, scourged with the utmost severity that could be
invented, and afterwards, by a special order, under the
hand of Agricolaus, beheaded by the common hangman,
15th <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 298, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Dioclesiani. The
church celebrateth the festival of this famous saint,
bishop, and martyr, February 3. The Council of
Lyons, <abbr title="anno Domini">ann. Dom.</abbr> 1244, under the Emperor Frederick
and Pope Innocent the Fourth, amongst other things
instituted certain new festivals for canonizing of
saints; after which time, in the Inquisition but now
mentioned, we shall find most of the names of our
Cornish churches distinguished by the prefixed title of
saint, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> such person as the same when first consecrated
was dedicated to (who before that time had been
canonized by the church of Rome); though, as I
hinted before, there is but one church or person named
in Domesday Roll to whom is given the appellation of
saint, about two hundred years before. In this church
town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey there is a public fair kept on the
festival day of this saint, February 3, and the festivals
of most other Cornish saints, to whose guardianship
churches are dedicated, are solemnly kept yearly in other
places.</p>

<p>Ro-sillian, in this parish, formerly the lands of Kellyow,

who giveth the same arms as that family doth.</p>

<p>In this parish also, not long since, lived Hugh Williams,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law, youngest son of Richard
Williams, of Trewithan in Probus, that married Robins
and Frowick, and gave the same arms as that family
doth; who at length, upon some discontent, with a rope
or halter privately hanged or strangled himself to death
in his own house (as was reported), though the coroner’s
inquest found it a chance only, tempore William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
Upon news of this fact of Mr. Williams, the uncharitable
<!--092.png--><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pageno">54</span>
country people, whom he had persecuted with
lawsuits, wished that all the rest of his brethren of the
inferior practice of the law, would make up of the same
expedient to hasten out of this life to Paradise as he did,
for the ease and public good of the inhabitants of this
county.</p>

<p>In this parish liveth Cur-lyon, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married
Hawkins, and giveth for his arms, in a field &mdash;&mdash;, a
bezant between two castles. Now, though the name be
local, from a place in Keye parish so called, yet if I were
admitted to judge or conjecture, I would say this family
of Cur-Lyon, by its name and arms, were the descendants
of Richard Curlyon, alias King Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> of
whom our chronologers say, that a priest of France
told him he had three daughters, Pride, Covetousness,
and Lechery; which three daughters the King replied
he would thus dispose of: 1, Pride to the Templars and
Hospitalers; 2, Covetousness to the Monks of the Cistertian
order; and, 3, Lechery to the clergy in general.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blaze, usually called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey. In this parish is
Roselian, or Rose-Sillian, an ancient seat belonging to
the family of Kellio, and was lately the residence of
Shadrack Vincent Vincent, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in right of his wife,
daughter of Richard Kellio, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>This Shadrack Vincent was the second son of Henry

wars of Flanders, and since the Revolution he has been
member of parliament for the borough of Fowey, and
has nobly founded a school there.</p>

<p>Adjoining to Roselian is Trenawick, which was sold
by &mdash;&mdash; Kellio, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> to Hugh Williams, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> son to

<p>The manor of Trengreene, or Tregoryon, is the dwelling
<!--093.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pageno">55</span>
of Thomas Carlyon, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> a branch of the Menagwins
family, who has lately built a very neat new house
here, which being seated on a rising grround, from
whence there is a good prospect of the sea, and having
a fruitful spot of land around it, is as pleasant a seat as
any in the neighbourhood. His son Thomas has married
Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Mr. Philip Hawkins,
of Pennance, by whom he hath several children.
This last Thomas was in the commission of the peace,
and died in this present Jan. (1732) leaving his eldest
son, Philip, a minor. This property belonged in former
times to the Bodregens.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The popular legends of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blaze relate that he was
most barbarously lacerated with wool-combs, which
sufficiently accounts for his having been adopted as the
patron of all persons concerned in the manufacture of
cloth.</p>

<p>There is an idle tradition of the exact spot where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Blaze landed; but it is quite certain that he never was in
the west of Europe; nor can any reason now be assigned
for the selection of this saint, beyond that of his general
popularity. About the year 1774 a curious piece of
machinery was exhibited all over England, which represented
the whole manufacture of broadcloth, from the
shearing of the wool to the last operation of pressing. A
small figure was actually at work on each separate process;
and over them all, as a general director, and arrayed
in his pontifical habit and mitre, appeared Bishop
Blaze. He is the patron of Ragusa.</p>

<p>The derivation of Carlyon from Richard Cœur de
Lion, seems to be equally puerile, unfounded, and absurd.
Car, or Caer, is evidently a fortified place; and
Lyon must be one of those corruptions, more common
than any other, of a word which has lost its appropriate
<!--094.png--><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
meaning, into another word of a similar sound and in
common use. The arms of Carlyon are, Argent, a chevron
Gules between three moor cocks Sable, limbed and
wattled Gules.</p>

<p>In modern times <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey has acquired distinction
by giving birth to Ralph Allen, known over England
as Mr. Allen of Bath. This gentleman acquired a large
fortune through the medium of conferring important
benefits on his country, and he employed it in promoting
literature and sciences on the most extensive scale.

house. Warburton was mainly through his influence

<p class="unindent">This extraordinary man was the son of an innkeeper
in a village on the road-side, called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey Highway.
He is stated by Mr. Polwhele to have been placed under
the care of his grandmother, who kept the post-office
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb; and that an inspector was so much
struck by the neatness and regularity of young Allen’s
accounts as to procure for him some situation in a more
extensive establishment. It is probable that he must
have been placed in the post office at Bath. Mr. Polwhele
adds that he was there patronised by General
Wade.</p>

<p>Previously to this period, letters were conveyed along
certain great roads emanating from the capital, but without
any communication one with the other. Mr. Allen
first conceived the idea of uniting these lines by what
has been termed cross posts, and Bath became the original
station of this most important contrivance, which
has now expanded itself over the whole country like the
meshes of a net, affording such facility and speed as to
astonish those who experience their benefit, and which
could not have been hoped for in times past.</p>

<p>It is much to be lamented that the progress of Mr.
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
Allen, from the commencement of his career in this
most interesting pursuit, up to the attainment of his
object by its complete establishment at Bath cannot
be traced; nor the source ascertained from whence his
funds were derived. It appears that Mr. Allen risked
the chance of taking the revenues to be derived from
his new institution for a term of years, at a certain
annual payment to the State; or, in official language,
that he farmed them; and his success proved commensurate
to the ability, exertion, and persevering industry
employed in carrying the plan into effect: so that on
the expiration of the first term, a renewal was taken at
an advanced rent of some tens of thousands a-year.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen fixed himself at Bath, and built the splendid
mansion of Prior Park with the oolite of that district, or
Bath stone, which he first quarried on an extensive scale
and brought into general use. At Prior Park every man
distinguished in any way was a welcome guest, and the
proprietor has received most justly, deserved tributes of
applause from many capable of erecting monuments
to his memory more durable than those of brass or stone;
but one frequently noticed has ever appeared to me
inadequate. It does indeed represent the image of a
private gentleman, endowed with goodness of heart,
some learning, and a tolerable judgment; but if Mr.
Fielding’s Allworthy was really meant to pourtray Mr.
Allen, one may seek in vain for any resemblance of a
man, who, by energy of mind and indefatigable exertions
conferred so great a benefit on his country, that
the wealth acquired by himself seemed no more than the
necessary appendage to such public service.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen died in 1764; but his spirit still hovered
over Bath, and impelled individuals brought forward in
his school, to make the second and last improvement in
our mail conveyances by substituting the rapid speed
of a coach, with its safety and accommodation of passengers,
for the slow and solitary progress of a postman on
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>
horseback. This system commenced in 1784, twenty
years after Mr. Allen’s decease. Mail coaches led to a
general improvement of roads, and this again to an increase
in the speed of coaches, while the reticulations of
cross posts became more fine, with intersections in every
possible direction, and the whole continues still improving;
so that, morally speaking, the illustrious founder
still lives and breathes among us.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen had a sister, whom I faintly remember the
widow of a Mr. Elliott, and left with an only daughter.
The old lady had great pleasure in relating what she had
seen and heard at Prior Park, her having been there in
company with Pope, Swift, Thomson, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and from her
is derived the story related by Mr. Polwhele of Mr.
Hugh Boscowen.</p>

<p>The daughter married Mr. Thomas Daniell, then chief
clerk to Mr. Lemon, an individual not moving in a sphere
so splendid as that of Mr. Allen, but probably at least
his equal in all the qualities essential to those who fix a
new era in the history of whatever they undertake.
On Mr. Lemon’s decease in 1760, Mr. Daniell was
enabled by the bounty of his wife’s uncle to take all the
large mercantile concern on himself, and having soon
afterwards constructed a residence in Truro, Mr. Allen
presented him with several ship-loads of Bath stone;
and thus Truro, having quarries of excellent silicious
building-stone almost in its streets, and with granite
distant only a few miles, exhibits the front of its most
handsome house encrusted with oolite from Bath. To
a similar act of liberality on the part of Mr. Allen, the
hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew in London is indebted for
an exterior casing of the same stone; which, in consequence
of the recent improvements and extension of
inland navigation, is now brought in great quantities to
the metropolis, to Oxford, and to places still more remote
from the quarries.</p>

<p>I may here perhaps introduce with propriety a relation
<!--097.png--><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
descriptive of the immense difference between our own
times and those of Queen Anne, in respect to the sources
and to the diffusion of intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney Godolphin, occupying the office of Lord
High Treasurer, visited more than once the seat in
Cornwall from which he derived his appellation of Earl;
no regular conveyances at stated intervals proceeded
further west than Exeter, but when certain masses of
letters had accumulated, the whole were forwarded by
what was called the post. The Lord High Treasurer
had a weekly messenger from Exeter bringing letters,
despatches, and a newspaper; and on the fixed day of
his arrival all the gentlemen assembled at Godolphin
from many miles round to hear the newspaper read in the
great hall. This was told to my father by Mr. John
Borlase, father to the two Doctor Borlases, who had
himself been present. From ten to twenty daily papers
now reach Penzance in about forty hours from London.</p>

<p>Within my own remembrance a letter leaving London
on Monday night arrived at Penzance on Friday morning,
a letter and its answer occupying at present precisely
that time.</p>

<p>This parish measures 1480 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The northern part of this parish rests on granite,
and it approaches very nearly to the church. Proceeding
southward, the granite is succeeded by the
same kind of slate as that which is found in the adjacent
parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, both parishes lying parallel to
<!--098.png--><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pageno">60</span>
each other, in respect to a line extending from the granite
hills to the sea shore, have the same geological
structure.</p>

<p>It is known that within the memory of the last generation
the sea flowed up to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey Bridge; and various
indications of its having reached half a mile further
up the river have been detected: thus showing that the
sea, which has encroached on most parts of the coasts
of Cornwall, has at the same time been driven back
from the land. This effect is usually attributed to the
accumulation of detritus brought down from the hills
by rivers, more especially when they are in flood, and
undoubtedly this must be a generally operative cause;
but in this particular instance the effect must be mainly
ascribed to the wearing away of the diluvial sand-bank
at the head of the adjoining bay. The volume of this
river, and its consequent momentum, not having been
sufficient to counteract the deposition of sand by the
waves running up the estuary, with which, in their rapid
motion, they are always charged.</p>

<p>Blisland is situate in the hundred of Trig-minor, id

from Trig-major, which encompasseth a larger tract of
land on the sea-shore of the Irish Channel, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> that now

1696, £104. At the time of the Norman Conquest I
judge it was taxed under Udy or Pengally.</p>

<p>This manor of Blisland was heretofore invested with
the jurisdiction of life and limb within its precincts (the
lords whereof doubtless built or endowed the present
church); and within memory of the last age, the inhabitants
will tell you, that a person was executed, in the
gallows-field there, for robbing this parish church of its
silver cup and pattens belonging to the altar (vide
Mitchell). This manor of Blisland, tempore Hen. <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
was the lands of &mdash;&mdash;, who forfeited the same by
attainder of treason in Flammock’s rebellion, whereby it
fell to the crown; from whence it was conveyed to the
Stanhopes, and from them to Parker, and from Parker
to Reynolds, from Reynolds to Sprye, from Sprye to
Molesworth.</p>

<p>In this parish somewhere liveth Trese, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> The
name Tres, or Treas, is Cornish British, and signifies in
that language “the third,” and was a name taken up in
memory of the third son or person of the family from
whence he was descended, and is derived from the same
Japhetical origin as τριτος, tertius, “the third,” as the
Latin word <dfn>tres</dfn>. Treas is also “the third” in the Scots

<p>It is worthy of remark, that Mr. Pye, the present incumbent,
has been in possession of the living fifty-three
years; and that his predecessor, Mr. Hicks, held it
during sixty-two years; so that one change of rectors
has alone taken place in the long period of an hundred
and fifteen years; a case of successive longevity almost
unparalleled; and the more extraordinary in comparison
with the inheritance of family estates, when it is recollected
that each of those gentlemen must at the least
have completed the twenty-fourth year of his age before
he received induction to the benefice.</p>

<p>Doctor Boase remarks the eastern half of this parish
is situate on granite, which is of the same kind, and
belongs to the same insulated group, as that extending
into the parishes of Advent and of Alternun. The western
half consists of alternate layers of schistone and of
compact rocks, some of which approach near to greenstone.

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Boconnoc is situate in the hundred of West-well-shire,
so called from foys-fenton in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleother, id est, walled
well or spring of water, the original fountain of the
fay’s river, to distinguish it from East-well-shire aforesaid;

Wenow; south, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neepe; east, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Pynock. For the
compound name Bo-connoc, it is taken from the barton
and manor of land still extant there, with reference to
the beasts that depastured thereon; and signifies, prosperous,
successful, thriving cows, kine, or cattle. Which
place it seems was the voke lands of a considerable
tithing or lordship, with jurisdiction, at the time of the
Norman Conquest; for by the name of Boconnoc it
was taxed in Domesday roll <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087.</p>

<p>However, let it be observed that at the time of the
inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester,
before mentioned, 1294, there was no such endowed
church extant in Cornwall as Boconnoc; though in
Wolsey’s Inquisition 1521, it was taxed to the Pope’s

<p>This barton and manor of Boconnoc, in the time of
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> was the lands of Sir John Dawney, of
Sheviock, knight, whose daughter and heiress Emelyn,
was married to Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devon (and
third of that name and title, being the son of Hugh
Courtenay the 10th Earl of Devon, by Margaret, daughter
of Humphrey de Bohun, the 8th Earl of Hereford
and Essex, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of King
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>

Edward Courtenay the 12th Earl of Devon, surnamed
<span class="title">the blind</span> (that married Eleanor, daughter of Roger Mortimer,
Earl of March and Ulster, by whom he had issue
Edward Courtenay the 13th Earl of Devon) and Hugh
Courtenay his second son, to whom his mother gave
Boconnoc, in the beginning of the reign of King Henry
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> 1416. Upon this Hugh Courtenay, afterwards Sir
Hugh Courtenay, Knight, his elder brother Edward,
surnamed <span class="title">the blind</span>, at the especial request and instance
of his mother, Emelyn, (as Brooke, York Herald, informs
us) did by his indenture, bearing date the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of
King Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> confirm and assure to him, his heirs
and assigns for ever, the manors of Gotherington, Southallington,
and Slancomb-Dawney (from whence that
family was denominated) in the county of Devon, who
afterwards married Philippa, one of the daughters and
heirs of Sir Warren Archdeacon, Knight, of Haccomb
in the county of Devon, after which time he lived
sometimes in that place, at other whiles at Boconnoc;
whence it is we find in some authors this gentleman is
called Sir Hugh Courtenay of Boconnoc, and Sir Hugh
Courtenay of Haccomb, as if they had been different
persons. This Sir Hugh Courtenay had issue, by Archdeacon’s
daughter, Edward Courtenay of Haccomb; who
after the death of Humphrey Stafford was restored in
blood, and made the 16th Earl of Devon, in the first
year of the reign of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> He married
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Courtenay, of Moland,
Knight, and had issue William Courtenay, 17th
Earl of Devon, who married Katherine daughter of King
Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> and by her had issue, Henry Courtenay,
Marquis of Exeter, executed for treason, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry

he had issue Edward Courtenay the 18th Earl of Devon

Padua, in Italy, without issue, 1556, 4th of October.</p>

Edward Courtenay of Haccomb, or Boconnoc, aforesaid
16th Earl of Devon, had four sisters, as is set down
in his will, dated 1509, in the first year of the reign of
King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> which were thus disposed of in marriage,&mdash;Elizabeth
was married to John Trethyrfe of
Trethyrfe, from whom Courtenay of that place, and
Vyvyan of Trelowarren is descended; Maud to John
Arundell of Tolverne, from whom the Arundells of
Sythney, and by females the Trefusis of Trefusis, and
the Halses late of Fentongollan are descended: Isabel,
the third daughter, was married to William Moune,
from whom the Lord Mohun descended: Florence, the
fourth sister, was married to John Trelawney, from
whom the Trelawneys of Trelawne are descended.</p>

<p>Whether this lordship of Boconnoc fell to the Crown
by attainder of treason, upon the death of Henry Courtenay,
Marquis of Exeter, or was purchased from the
Crown, or of the sisters and heirs of the said Edward
Courtenay, by Carmenow of Fengollan, I know not; he
sold it to the Earl of Bedford; as the said Francis Russell,
Earl of Bedford sold it, in 1566, to Reginald Mohun,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (son or grandson of William Moune, who married
Isabel Courtenay aforesaid) that married Joan daughter

of Sir John Horsey, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> by whom he had issue,
Sir Reginald Mohun, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> that married two wives; the
first, Sir William Killigrew’s daughter; the second, a
daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Heale, of Wembury in Devon; the
which Sir Reginald, 15 November 1612, was created a
Baronet of England, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and had issue, John
Mohun, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who in the lifetime of his father was created
Baron Mohun of Oakhampton in right of his grandmother
Isabel&mdash;&mdash;, sister of Edward Courtenay,
the 16th Earl of Devon, lord of the manor, honour, and
borough of Oakhampton, who married and had issue
Warwick Lord Mohun, who had issue Charles Lord
<!--104.png--><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pageno">66</span>
Mohun, who had issue, as I take it, another Charles
Lord Mohun, who was slain in a duel between him and
the Duke of Hamilton, who both died on the spot, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Queen Anne: after which his daughters and heirs sold
this lordship and all his lands to Mr. Thomas Pitt, recently
returned from the East Indies.</p>

<p>The ancestor of this ancient and famous family of the
Mohuns came into England with William the Conqueror,
by the name of William Mowne or Sapell, and
was after the Conquest by him made Governor of Dunster
Castle, who had issue William Mowne the second
Lord of Dunster Castle, whose son, the third William,
as Matthew Paris saith, did keep and fortify the same
against King Stephen, for the use of Maud the Empress.
It is told us by our chronologers and historians, that he
was made Earl of Somerset by King Henry the First,
1135, and that he was founder of a priory of Black
Canons of Bruton in Somersetshire, where Edgar Earl
of Cornwall had before founded an abbey of Benedictine
monks. (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide Monasticon Anglicanum</span>, <abbr title="tome two page">tom. ii. p.</abbr>
205,) to which charter were witnesses William de Moyn,
his son, and others.</p>

<p>This William Earl of Somerset had issue another
William, who is said also to have been Earl of Somerset:
but Brooke, York Herald, says that this William
and his son Reginald Lord Dunster both died in the time
of William Earl of Somerset, so that Reginald de Moyn
his grandson was the second and last Earl of Somerset
of his name and family, who lost this hereditary office
by siding with the Barons against King Henry the
Third, A.D. 1297, after it had remained in his family
about fifty years.</p>

<p>After the family became private gentlemen at Boconnoc,
their names are found sometimes noticed; the first
Sheriff of Cornwall, 6th <abbr title="Edward Six">Edw. VI.</abbr> 1 <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> 13 <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> and

<p>Bo-con-oke; the name is Gaulish-Saxon,&mdash;the town
or village of Stunt Oke.</p>

<p>After copying Mr. Hals’ narrative, Mr. Tonkin adds,
Charles Lord Mohun, the last Baron of this family,
being killed in a duel by the Duke of Hamilton, on the
5th of November 1712, left his whole estate by will,
dated some time before, to his widow, who sold all the
Cornish and Devonshire estates in 1717 for fifty-four
thousand pounds (a very cheap bargain) to Thomas
Pitt, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> commonly called Governor Pitt, in whose
possession the manor of Boconnoc now remains.</p>

<p>This Charles Lord Mohun was a nobleman of very
bright parts, and great natural endowments both of body
and mind; but having had the misfortune to lose his
father, while he was yet in the cradle&mdash;and the estate
being left to him much involved in lawsuits between his
nearest relations, and with a considerable debt&mdash;he had
not an education bestowed on him suitable to his birth;
and happening to fall into ill company, he was drawn
into several extravagancies: but, however, as his years
increased, he became so much reclaimed as to give
great hopes that he would one day equal the greatest of
his predecessors; when he was thus unfortunately cut
off in the flower of his age.</p>

<p>He was twice married. First to Charlotte daughter of
&mdash;&mdash; Manwaring, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he had only one daughter,
whom he never owned, and he lived for several years
separated from his wife. He had the good fortune, however,
to get rid of her at last, she being drowned in a
passage to Ireland with one of her gallants, about six or
seven years before his own death.</p>

<p>Fitton Gerrard, Earl of Macclesfield, her maternal
uncle, to make him some amends for his bad bargain,
gave him by will a good part of his estate, in 1701,
which was the occasion of the quarrel between his
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
Lordship and the Duke of Hamilton; so fatal to them
both.</p>

<p>His second wife was the widow of Colonel Griffin, of

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Boconnoc is universally allowed to be the finest seat
in Cornwall. The house stands on an elevation near
the union of two valleys, each rendered interesting,
beautiful, and picturesque by streams of water flowing
through uneven ground, and by native woods of beech
and oak, rivalling the trees of our most favoured inland
counties, although these vallies originate in wild tracts
of land where not a stunted shrub is to be seen.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Pitt, although remotely descended from
a good family, is said to have been the son of a person
concerned in trade at Brentford. He must have gone to
India at a time when some merchant adventurers, wholly
unconscious of impending events, were engaged in laying
the foundation of an Empire so vast as to exceed in the
number of its subjects even the majesty of Rome itself.
Mr. Pitt returned to Europe possessed of a diamond,
superior, perhaps, in its combination of size and transparency,
to any one ever exhibited in the western
world. It was offered to Queen Anne, and ultimately
sold to the Regent Duke of Orleans for the French
nation, at a sum exceeding one hundred thousand
pounds.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span>
With about half of this large sum Mr. Pitt
acquired the property in Cornwall of the last Lord Mohun,
and settled at Boconnoc. He also purchased the
burgage tenures, giving the right of franchise at Old
Sarum, and represented that place in Parliament.</p>

<p><!--107.png--><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
He had two sons, Robert and Thomas. Robert Pitt
who succeeded him at Boconnoc, married Harriet Villiers,
third sister of John Earl Grandison. He died
in May 1727, leaving two sons, Thomas Pitt, and William,
afterwards Earl of Chatham. Thomas Pitt, his
brother, was created Earl of Londonderry, in consequence
of his marrying the heiress of Ridgeway, who
had borne that distinction; this younger branch became
extinct in 1764. Thomas Pitt, his son, engaged most extensively
in the political speculation, for which Cornwall
was then become an ample field. But, having supported
the party of Frederick Prince of Wales, he failed of obtaining
any of the objects to which most speculations are
supposed to lead. He married Christiana, sister of George
first Lord Lyttelton; by whom he left Thomas Pitt, who,
on the elevation of his first cousin, William Pitt, to the
chief office in the State, when under twenty-five years of
age, was created Baron Camelford in Jan. 1784. He died
in 1793, leaving a son Thomas Pitt, the second and last
Lord Camelford, and a daughter married to William
Wyndham Grenville, Lord Grenville, the present possessor
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
of Boconnoc, having succeeded to her brother
in 1804.</p>

<p>The personal history of this young man is curious and
extraordinary. He became an object of attention in
Cornwall almost from his birth. On the event of his
christening, in 1775, Boconoc was thrown open for public
and indiscriminate entertainment, accompanied by
exhibitions of the peculiar athletic exercise in which the
Cornish boast to excel all their contemporaries, and to
rival the Palæstræ of ancient Greece. A silver bowl of
fifteen guineas was the prize of the victor (the first who
threw five falls), and about fifty pounds were distributed
among the vanquished.</p>

<p>His education was conducted under a private tutor
alone in the seclusion of Boconnoc; but having made
an excursion to Plymouth at a time when naval preparations
were in full activity, he acquired a passion for
the sea so strong and rooted, as not to be overcome by
all the efforts of authority or of advice.</p>

<p>He went on the perilous voyage of discovery conducted
by Captain Vancouver, and in the course of it,
he is said to have experienced some harsh treatment on
the part of the commmander, which seems to have
stamped a new impression on his mind, rendered permanent
by the long period during which it was necessarily
concealed.</p>

<p>On Lord Camelford’s return to England, the effects
burst forth in acts of violence against Captain Vancouver,
and from that time,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">On each adventure rash he roved,</div>
  <div class="i0">As danger for itself he loved.</div>
</div>

<p>It is impossible not be struck by a general resemblance
between the two individuals who last possessed
Boconnoc, of the families of Mohun and Pitt. Both
seem to have been men of ability and of genius, of intrepid
courage and of honour, fond of enterprise, and
with vigour of body commensurate to their mental energies;
<!--109.png--><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
but each unfortunately, obeying the impulse of
passion and of strong feelings rather than the dictates
of reason, was hurried on to an untimely fate. The
latter fell by the hand of a person born to the situation
of a gentleman, but in other respects little entitled to
that distinction.</p>

<p>The first Lord Camelford might not only claim a full
share of the hereditary talent connected with the names
of Lyttelton and of Pitt;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span>
but also literary acquirements
and taste obtained under the guidance of his two uncles
William Pitt Lord Chatham, and Lord Lyttelton. His
gratitude to the latter is commemorated at Boconnoc
by a lofty obelisk.</p>

<p>Lord Camelford introduced to the rectory of his parish
the Reverend Benjamin Forster, a contemporary at
Cambridge of congenial taste, and worthy of his friendship,
the associate of Gray and of Mason; and with a
mind like theirs suited for retirement and for literary
leisure.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span>
In his hours of relaxation he adorned the woods
and shades, the vales and the rivulets, of Boconnoc with
descriptive and appropriate illustrations from ancient
and from modern poetry. To the Glebe-house he applied,</p>

 <div class="poem">
  <div class="i0">A little lowly hermitage it was,</div>
  <div class="i2">Down in a dale, hard by a forest’s side,</div>
  <div class="i0">Far from resort of people that did pass</div>
  <div class="i2">In travail to and fro.</div>
 </div>

<p>Mr. Forster has been long since deceased, his rectory
taken down, and most of his friends departed from this
life. His memory is for the present preserved by a
tablet (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">brevi et ipsa interitura</span>) bearing the following

<p>The Geology of this parish has nothing peculiar or
characteristic. Dr. Boase remarks that the eastern part
is a continuation of the barren downs which extend
nearly to Lostwithiel, and that the southern, which is
the fertile part, belongs to the calcarious series of the
schistose group, but that the rocks are too much concealed
under the alluvial soil to allow of their nature
being very evidently manifest.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Bodmin is situate in the hundred of Trigg, and hath
upon the north Helland, south Lanhydrock, west
Lanivet, east Cardinham. In Domesday Roll 1067,
or 1087, it was rated by the name of Bod-ran, id est,
command, authority, or jurisdiction share, or division.
In some other ancient manuscripts, Bod-man.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals gives here a long detailed account of the
supposed Bishopric of Bodmin, and of the Bishops
themselves, with a great variety of collateral incidents;
but the late Mr. Whitaker has shown, in his learned
work on “The Cathedral of Cornwall,” that the whole
is devoid of any foundation whatever. It is therefore
omitted; and the reader desirous of information and
entertainment is referred to that curious production of
our learned antiquary.]</p>

<p>Algar Earl of Cornwall, successor of Ailmer, (as the
Monasticon Anglicanum, <abbr title="tome one, page">tom. i. p.</abbr> 213, and <abbr title="tome two, page">tom. ii. p.</abbr>
205, informs us,) at his own proper cost and charges
re-edified the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter at Bodmin, as it now
stands; consisting of three roofs, each sixty clothyards
long, thirty broad, and twenty high, so that for bulk and
magnificence it is parallel to the cathedral of Kirton,
and little inferior to that of Exeter. Earl Algar gave
the church to a society of Augustines or Black Canons.</p>

<p>Afterwards, if Leland’s manuscripts may be credited,
those Black Canons were displaced, and succeeded by
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict’s monks; and then again those monks
were displaced, and succeeded by a nunnery of Benedictine
nuns. Then again, saith he, those nuns were
displaced, and succeeded by secular priests; who also
were again displaced, and Canons Regular, or Black
Canons Augustine, restored to their places; under which
circumstance of religious men Leland found it when
<!--112.png--><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
King Henry the Eighth sent him into Cornwall, to inspect
the orders and revenues of the religious houses
therein. And in this state it was found by the Commissioners,
26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> when dissolved, at which
time its revenue yearly was valued at 270<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> Dugdale;
269<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 11<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
11<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Speed. Now this value, the reader
must observe, was only the conventionary or annual
rent reserved on leases of the priory land, set out to
tenants for 99 years, determinable upon lives, and the
common way of valuing those old rents was after the
rate of ten per cent.; so that 270<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> rent was then worth
2,700<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> now worth
6,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum: which lands and
rents are now chiefly in the hands and possession of
Godolphin, Buller, Robarts, Morrice, Prideaux, Vivian,
Rashleigh, Nicholls, Moyle, Molesworth, and many
others.</p>

<p>The churches appropriated to this priory were, 1. Bodmin,
2. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn, 3. Withiel, 4. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, 5. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock,
6. Little Pederick, 7. Padstow, 8. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ervan, 9. Crantock,
10. Cubert, 11. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb-minor, 12. Tregony, 13.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Minver, 14. Lanhydrock, and some others, whereof
the priors were either patrons or founders.</p>

<p>The Prior of this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter kept his treasurer,
his steward, almoner, hospitalarius, et infirmarius,
that took care of sick and weak beggars and travellers.
The priory-house wherein he dwelt is yet extant, though
his domestic chapel and burial-place be dilapidated and
demolished, all contiguous with the church aforesaid.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction and royalty over the river Alan, from
Camelford to Padstow Rock, was given to this Prior by
Algar Earl of Cornwall, in right of his manor of Helston,
in this hundred, excepting the right of free fishing
to the tenants thereof; a river famous for infinite number
of those kings of fishes called salmon, which between
Midsummer and Christmas are taken there, reputed, by
such as are skilled in the gusto or palate, the best of
that kind in Cornwall (except the salmon of the Val
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
river, in this county). But, since the dissolution of this
priory by King Henry the Eighth, this royalty is disjointed,
if not dismembered from it, and enjoyed in
co-partnership by such as are the now owners of its
lands and revenues, and by some others whose lands are
contiguous with that river; though the now Duchy
tenants of the manor of Helston aforesaid still pay barbe-agu,
or bar-ba-gut money, id est, barbed-spear money,
annually to the Duke of Cornwall, who is Lord thereof,
for free fishing with salmon-spears.</p>

<p>The list or catalogue of the names of the Priors
of this church is lost, except Thomas Vivian, the last
save one;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span>
a man famous in his days for his piety
and charities, as his benefactions make him still memorable
in ours; for he built the rectory-house at
Withall, the mansion-house at Ryalton, the south roof
at Edleshayle church, and the lofty spire and steeple
lately upon his prioral, now parochial church of Bodmin
aforesaid, which was all struck down with lightning
and thunder anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1699, and since again re-edified
as it now stands, without a spire, at the proper cost and
charge of the inhabitants of Bodmin town and parish.</p>

<p>This Prior Vivian was by the Pope consecrated Bishop
of Megara, in Achaia, a city of Greece. He lies entombed
with his bust or skeleton within a costly and
curious stone chest or monument, about seven feet long,
and three feet high above ground, on the top of which
is cut at full length his portraiture as a man, and on this
figurative body his episcopal robes, his mitre on his
head, his staff or crosier in his hand, his face encompassed
over with the wings of two cherubim standing
by: somewhat defaced in the interregnum of Cromwell,
as a superstitious monument. This tomb is also adorned
round with crosses; the arms of his Bishopric of Megara,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field Gules, three human thigh-bones saltirewise
Or, or Proper; the arms of his priory aforesaid;
<!--114.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
the arms of England, France, and Ireland; and lastly,
that of his own or his ancestors’ arms, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field
Argent, on a chevron Azure three annulets, between
three bears’ heads erased and muzzled Sable, on a chief
Gules three martlets Or; which are arms of a strange
confused bearing, according to the rules of heraldry,
composed or consisting of two of the honourable ordinaries,
a chevron and a chief, and the same charged
with martlets and annulets, of colours yellow, white,
red, blue, and black, charge upon charge, and colours
upon colours; all which monument is surrounded with
an ancient and broken inscription to this purpose:</p>

<p class="blockquote unindent" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic tumulatus venerabilis Pater Thomaus Vivian,
Megarensis Episcopus, hujus domus Prior; qui obiit
tertio die Junii, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1533. Cujus animæ propitietur
Deus. Amen.</p>

<p>This church of the Prior’s, after dissolution of the
priory aforesaid, was converted to a parochial church
for the parish and town of Bodmin, and the secular
church of <a name="err9" id="err9"></a>Beni left to fall into utter ruin and decay, as
it now stands; and is discontinued either for use of living
or dead human creatures, the tower only standing, and
cattle daily depasturing in the same, and the cemetery
thereof, as in other places.</p>

<p>Also this prioral rectory church, long before its dissolution,
was converted by the Prior into a vicarage
church; for in the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln
and Winchester before mentioned, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1294,

taxed to the Pope’s annats <abbr title="six">vi</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>

<p>In Bodmin churchyard is a well-built school-house,
built over a very spacious charnel-house or grott, where
<!--115.png--><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
are piled up the dry bones of such men and women as
are found in new-made graves, to put the scholars and
townsmen in mind of mortality; and is now commonly
called the Bone-house. This school Queen Elizabeth
endowed with about 16<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> per annum revenues
out of the Exchequer for ever.</p>

<p>The name Bodmin anciently comprehended no more
than the town or borough itself, as it is now taxed in
the Exchequer; for in the Domesday tax Beni, Lanlaran,
now <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, and Lantallan, were districts
rated by themselves, though now consorted under that
name of Bodmin parish and town. It is called a burge,
or burghs, from the same Japhetical original as the
Cornish word purguse, πυργος [purgus], turris, a tower,
castle, fenced or fortified place, from whence the Latins
had their word burgus, of the same import; and suitable
thereto, notable it is, this town hath in it still a place
called Tower-hill; as also, that every considerable town
or burg in Cornwall heretofore had near it, for its defence,
some castle, tower, or citadel, to defend it from
the invasion of enemies. And agreeably to this interpretation
and custom, Bodmin town, upon the east part
thereof, upon a high-mounted hill, hath still extant
the ruins and downfalls of a treble British entrenchment,
containing above twelves acres of ground, formerly
and still called Castle Kynock, alias Cunock,
synonymous words, i. e. the King’s, or the supreme and
sovereign castle. (See Truro, Launceston, Saltash, Helston,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> for the like.)</p>

<p>Hence it is in the Cornish-British we have πυργες,
purges, Anglice burgess, or a citizen (from whence the
Latins had their word burgensis), which signifies an inhabitant
of such a place as kept a tower, castle, fort, or
hold, or had a college-court of purgesses (now burgesses)
in it. And I doubt that, long before the Norman Conquest,
or bishopric here was erected, this town of Bodmin
<!--116.png--><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pageno">78</span>
by prescription was invested with the jurisdiction of a
court-leet, (id est, a court that kept a law-day, or festival,)
though the same was not confirmed by a charter or incorporated
before King John, A.D. 1216, granted one
thereto; whereby he privileged the same with the tribunal
also of a mayor, recorder, town clerk, twelve aldermen,
and twenty-four common-councilmen, or assistants,
who have power to nominate and elect a new mayor
annually by the majority of voices, as also members of
parliament. The mayor and town clerk, and last preceding
mayor, justices of the peace for one year after
within the said borough; the town clerk during life.
This town and borough is held of the King of Great
Britain, and pays annually to the King’s Audit at
Launceston between five and six pounds per annum
rent, beyond the records of time.</p>

<p>By the same charter it was made also one of the
towns for coinage of tin, though long since discontinued
(see Lostwithiel for the Tinners’ Charter); and
made also the only staple town in Cornwall where in a
public market merchants might carry their goods for
wholesale, and whereby the mayor and town clerk also
were authorized to take the acknowledge of statute staple
bonds between party and party as the law directs.</p>

<p>Now to remove an action depending in this court-leet
of Bodmin to any superior court, the writ must be
thus directed:</p>

This town, for number of inhabitants (as in Mr.
Carew’s time, 1602) far exceeds any other town in
Cornwall; which is also privileged by its charter with
keeping a weekly market on Saturdays, wherein is
vended of all creatures both living and dead, corn, fish,
and fowl, and all other things necessary for the life of
man, in such great abundance, and at a moderate price,
as the same equals if not exceeds the markets of Tavistock
and Exeter, in Devon. It is also appurtenanced
with fairs, upon January 25th, December 6th, Saturday
after Mid-lent Sunday, and on Wednesday before Whitsun-day.
There is a street in this town called Cassiter-street,
that is to say, Woodland-street. (See Falmouth,
for Cassiter and Cassiteros.)</p>

<p>I have been told that, within the memory of sixty years
last past, there was extant within this town and parish
the remains, ruins, and dilapidated walls of no less than
13 churches or free chapels, wherein heretofore God was
duly worshipped, perhaps first erected by those religious
persons mentioned by Leland, who had so often been
displaced or turned out from the priory as aforesaid.</p>

<p>But, above all others, there is still extant in this town
the stately church of the Franciscan Friars, dedicated to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas, and their cells, consisting of one roof
twenty clothyards high and fifty long, with two stone-windows,
admirable for height, breadth, and workmanship;
which, after the dissolution of their house and
order by King Henry the Eighth, the justices of the
peace of this county appointed for a house of correction
for such vagrant and idle persons as the same afforded,
by the name of the Friary and Shire-hall; which the
townsmen taking notice of, soon after converted or profaned
it further to a common market-house, for selling
corn, wool, and other commodities weekly; yea, and
within the same is kept yearly several fairs for selling
all sorts of merchandize, the altars being pulled down,
and in the churchyard, or burial-place, a fair for cattle.
<!--118.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>
It also lately made the tribunal or hall for the judges of
assize yearly, and the justices of the peace in their sessions,
and is undoubtedly, except Westminster Hall, the
fairest and best in England.</p>

<p>The stone font of this church for baptizing infants is
now converted to a measure for corn in this hall, which
also, as I said, is the weekly market-house. On the
same is an inscription in old characters, which I leave
for abler capacities than mine to interpret.</p>

<p>The founder of those Cordelier or Franciscan Friars
was Francis of Assium, in Italy, who was born about
the year 1140. His parents placed him to school for
some time to study the liberal arts and sciences, and
afterwards placed him to the trade and occupation of a
merchant, which in Italy still, as anciently it was
amongst the Jews, is so reputable an employment that
even princes themselves are merchants: which trade or
occupation Francis followed, with small gain or advantage,
in a fair and righteous way, for some time, but
growing discontented thereat, and not knowing thereby
well how to subsist, he resolved, as others did, to follow
indirect arts and practices to get more riches, by stealing
the duties of such goods and merchandize as he
bought and sold, which then was, and still is, a capital
crime in Italy; and accordingly put the same in practice,
and much enriched himself thereby, though at
length his fraud was detected, himself indicted, tried for
his life, and condemned to death for the same. Whereupon,
in order to prevent the sentence inflicted upon
him, and to avoid the halter, he gave the greatest part
of his goods and estate to his prince, to grant or procure
his pardon, and the other part to pious uses, in
relieving the poor, and re-edifying and endowing three
churches. Afterwards he fell into such great horror
and trouble of conscience for those facts, and that he
was fully informed from Hosea <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 7 and 8, that a
merchant cannot be without guile, nor a victualler without
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
sin, it so wrought upon him, that he did not only
renounce his trade of a merchant, but also forsook all
worldly affairs, and took upon himself the vows of obedience,
poverty, and chastity; and under the habit of a
grey cover, or scapula, and a coat of the same, surrounded
or girded in the middle with a twisted rope,
cord, or halter, in memory of his deliverance from it and
the gallows, as aforesaid, with naked legs and discalceated
feet, he forsook his house, and went about the
country preaching the Gospel gratis, subsisting only on
the alms and charity of his hearers, and what was wanting
in that particular was made up by downright beggary.
And in short time he so far prevailed with the
people by his predicatements, that divers brethren went
about with him, following the same manner of life,
under the rules and habit aforesaid, which gave him
occasion or opportunity to lay the foundation of the
first convent in Christendom of his order at Assissium
aforesaid, and obtained a confirmation of his rule from
the Pope; and two years after his death, 4th <abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 1228,
was by him canonized for a saint.</p>

<p>However, let it be remembered here, that afterwards
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bonaventure, being at the 18th year of his age entered
of this order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, and in the general
chapter of Narbonne chosen minister general of those
friars, he then so altered and regulated his rule and
order, or rather reformed it, that ever since it might
more aptly be called the order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bonaventure than
that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis. Which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bonaventure afterwards
being made a Bishop, and one of the Cardinals of
Rome, wrote the Life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis in Latin, and therein
recounted so many stories of his conversion as aforesaid,
of his perfection, religion, reparation of three
churches, his sincere, mortified life, and the manner of
preparing creatures for his refection, his humility, obedience,
condescension, and bowing downwards of himself,
his love of poverty, the wonderful supply of his
<!--120.png--><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pageno">82</span>
wants, his affections towards piety, his desire of martyrdom,
his study, and virtuous orations, his skill in Scripture
and spirit of prophecy, his efficacious predicatements,
his sacred marks, and holy chastisements of his
body, his patience in undergoing the pangs of death,
4th <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 1226, that in this place I have only room to
name them. And as a surplusage thereto, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bonaventure,
as also Alosi Lepomani, Bishop of Seville, ascribe
to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, before and after his death, the doing of
no less than 113 miracles, or supernatural acts, which,
I think, are more than are recorded by the sacred writings
to be done by our Saviour Jesus.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all that is done and said by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bonaventure in praise of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, he did not much
rely upon the merit of him or any other Saint, since it
is an established sanction at the end of all his hymns
pertaining to this order of Franciscans,</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Soli gloria tibi, Domine, qui natus es de Virgine.</div>
</div>

<p>Now though this Order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, after convents
were erected and endowed, for the most part lived in
convents under these rules as aforesaid, without alms or
begging, yet a particular sort of them went abroad to
preach the Gospel in parochial churches and free chapels,
where the rector, vicar, curate, or chaplain was no
preacher, and administered the sacraments as occasion
required; having, moreover, committed to their charge
or jurisdiction, by the Pope, the commutation of penance
for sins committed; and, because by their rule they were
not to take money, they took the same in corn, wool,
fruits, fields, goods, and chattels, for their Superior.
Those kind of missionaries were called Friars Observants,
and went at large as supervisors, who pretended to a
stricter observation of their rule than the master conventuals
that went not abroad. What revenues this
stately church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis at Bodmin had at its dissolution
I know not, neither doth the Monasticon Anglicanum
inform me; besides five quarterly pence, and
<!--121.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pageno">83</span>
twenty penee by the year out of every family or dwelling-house
in Cornwall, that was not excused propter
paupertatem. Supplication of Beggars to Henry the
Eighth, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 2.</p>

<p>Those Franciscan friars, Mendicant or Minors, came
not into England till Henry the Third’s days (since
which time this church at Bodmin must be erected)
in all but nine in number, who landed at Dover; five
of which went to Canterbury, where, by the King’s
leave, they built the first convent in England of their
order; four went to London, and had a place given
them in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas Shambles, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1260, to
erect another convent or monastery, by John Jewyn,
merchant. However, let it be remembered that the
Black Friars Mendicant, or Augustines, were founded
by William de Paris, and first brought into England in
the time of William the Conqueror, to whom Robert
Kilwarby, Archbishop of Canterbury tempore William
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr> at the west end of London, on the bank of the
Thames, founded and endowed there a monastery to
them. For White Friars, or Cistersians, see Kilkhampton;
for Dominicans, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick. Carmelite Friars
were founded at Carmellus, a town in Syria; as also a
latter order of those discalceated friars were founded by
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary de Theresa, of Jesus, of the blessed Lady of
Mount Carmel, 1540. She was a native of Castile, and
died 4th October, 1582, in the 68th year of her age, and
47th of being religious. She was canonized by Pope
Gregory <abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr> 12th March 1622. The Friars of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Francis of Paula, in Italy, were founded by him 1414;
little different from those others. Finally of these friars:
Bishop Usher, in his Discourse of the Primitive Church,
fully demonstrates that, before the Reformation of religion,
besides monks there were in this land, of the five
orders, above thirty thousand begging friars.</p>

<p>At Lan-car, in this parish, (rest-rock, or rock-temple,
if ever any church or chapel was extant here, otherwise,
<!--122.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pageno">84</span>
by the rock may be signified some notable stone-quarry
found in those lands,) was the dwelling of John
Mountstephens, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sometime member of parliament
for West Looe, who purchased the same from Mr. Bullock.
He was the son of Mounts or Stephens, alias
Mountstephen, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn, and had his first education
under Mr. Stephens, sometime schoolmaster of Bodmin,
to whom at length he became usher; afterwards
was clerk or servitor to William Lilly, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and so became
an undergraduate in Oxford; and, being recommended
by him to the notice of the Earl of Sunderland,
Lord President of the Council <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> he made
him one of his clerks or secretaries, which circumstance
further brought him to the knowledge of Jonathan Lord
Bishop of Bristol, by whose interest he obtained a burgess-ship
at West Looe for the parliament, and was
afterwards made one of the Commissioners for the King’s
Tin-farm in those parts; by which ways and means he
got himself considerable wealth and reputation.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding all those his prosperous successes
of fortune, in the month of December, or beginning
of January, 1706, aged about 60 years, when he was
at London, a member of parliament as aforesaid, and in
his own house till eleven of the clock, one day upon
some discontent went from his company, and so into a
more retired apartment, where he took a razor and cut
his own throat, and instantly fell dead on the spot, the
razor by his side all bloody, to the great terror and amazement
of his domestics, who found him in that posture.</p>

<p>Various were the reports and sayings of people upon
occasion of this sad accident; some said it was for that he
made addresses of marriage to a gentlewoman above his
degree, who rejected his amours, upon account of some
concubine, or bedfellow, he kept at Truro; others, with
more probability, gave out that he was detected by the
Earl of Sunderland (who raised him) for eighteen years’
space to have been a French pensioner, and to have
<!--123.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
received a great sum of money annually for communicating
the secrets of the Queen and Parliament to the
Secretary of the French King, which as soon as he understood,
by a letter shown him under his own hand, he
instantly went home to his lodgings, burnt all his papers,
and committed the felo-de-se aforesaid.</p>

<p>Bo-carne,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span>
in this parish, id est, cows, kine, cattle, and
white spar-stones, comparatively rocks, is the dwelling
of William Flammock, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Reynolds,
and giveth for his arms, out of a supposed allusion to
their name, Argent, a chevron between three estoiles
Sable, (that is, in a wavy or flaming posture,) for flammock,
after the Cornish-British, must be interpreted a
flame and smoke; since the Latin words <dfn>flamma</dfn>, or
flame, or bright burning fire-sparkle, and <dfn>flammans</dfn>,
burning, flaming, are both derived from the British word
flam; for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exæstuo</i> is the proper and native word, to
burn, or flame.</p>

<p>Again, this family indifferently wrote their name
Flam-mank, Flam-manc, id est, in Cornish, flaming or
burning glove, sleeve, or gauntlet; so called, perhaps,
for that some of this family was a notable soldier, and
famous in the combat at sword and gauntlet, (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> military
glove,) or a sleeve and gorget of mail, as the above
name. And flammock may relate to some soldier of this
tribe that was as renowned in his charge with the fusee
or firelock, soon after the invention of guns: for Camden,
in his Remains, tells us that in Edward the Third’s
French wars gunaria, or gunarii, had its pay; which
was before the invention of guns in Germany.</p>

<p>But if flammeck, flammeg, flammock, be a monosyllable,
and not a compound or conjugated word, it signifies
in British blear-eyed-ness, or one that hath a
sparkling or flaming eye, either by natural or accidental
infirmity, an obstruction of sight.</p>

<p>I take this gentleman to be the lineal descendant of
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
that Mark Le Flemanc who was possessed of 16<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> rents
in lands and tenements in Cornwall, 40th Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
(Carew’s Survey,) that were held by the tenure of knight’s
service, and was no knight; who was obliged by his
tenure to send into the King’s army a man and horse
armed with lorica, capello ferri, gladio, et cultello, a
breastplate, a brigandine, an iron headpiece, a sword
and cuttler. As was also that Thomas Flammock, a
lawyer, in the reign of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1496, who,
together with Michael Joseph, a smith of these parts,
stirred up the Cornish people to a rebellion against that
prince, under the pretence of the severity of a land tax,
though it was but a subsidy of an hundred and twenty
thousand pounds, charged by Act of Parliament for one
year of the thirty-seven shires of England, towards the
Scotch war; which, after the severest imposition, could
not amount to above 2,500<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> on this county. But really
the ground and design of this insurrection was to depose
King Henry from his crown and dignity, and in his
stead to set up Edmund de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, the
true heir male of the House of York, sister’s son to King
Edward the Fourth. Which being well understood by
the inhabitants of Cornwall, gave Flammock and Joseph
opportunity to raise such an army, as thereby to become
so formidable that John Basset, of Tehidy, then Sheriff,
with his posse comitatus, dared not encounter them.
Whereupon they marched with their army, consisting
of about six thousand men, from Bodmin to Launceston,
and from thence into Devon; where also they appeared
so tremendous that Sir William Carew, Knight, then Sheriff
thereof, with his posse comitatus, would not venture a
battle with them, but suffered them (either through fear
or affection) to pass through his Bailiwick into Somersetshire,
and so Taunton there; in which place they
slew the Provost Perrin, a commissioner for the subsidy
aforesaid, and then advanced to Wells; where James
Touchet, Lord Audley, knowing the mystery of their
<!--125.png--><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>
design, confederated with them, and became their general.
Soon after, they published their declaration of
pretended grievances, chiefly concerning the said land
tax, and wholly laying the blame of that exaction upon
John Martin, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Reginald
Bray, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> two of the King’s Council, whom they
would have removed from that station.</p>

<p>Upon which pretence (and the secret reserve aforesaid)
the people, being better affected to the House of York
than to that of Lancaster, suffered these rebels quietly
to march from Wells to Salisbury, from Salisbury to
Winchester, and from thence into Kent, where they expected
great aid and assistance; but when they came
there, contrary to promise and to expectation, no person
came to their help: but on the contrary, for the King
there appeared in arms against them, with the Earl of
<a name="err10" id="err10"></a>Kint, the Lord Abergavenny, Sir John Brook, Lord Cobham,
and divers other gentlemen, with great forces, to
stop their further proceedings that way. Upon which
disappointment, the rebels turned their march towards
London, and encamped upon Blackheath, about four
miles from thence; where they had not long been before
they were encountered by Giles Lord Daubeny, King
Henry’s general, who, after a short conflict with them,
and the loss of three hundred soldiers on the King’s
part, and two thousand on the Rebels’ side, the remainder
of them fell into despair, threw down their arms,
craved mercy, and yielded themselves prisoners. The
King pardoned many; but of the chief authors of the
insurrection none. The Lord Audley was committed to
Newgate, and from thence drawn to Tower-hill in his
coat-armour (painted on paper), reversed and torn,
where he was beheaded. Flammock and Michael Josepp
the smith, were hanged, drawn, and quartered, and <a name="err11" id="err11"></a>has
their heads and quarters pitched upon stakes set up in
London and other places, June 26, 1496. [See Lord
Bacon’s History of King Henry the Seventh. An opinion
<!--126.png--><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
is still prevalent in Cornwall, that after themselves
the people of Kent are the most brave in England.]</p>

<p>This town and parish of Bodmin is also notable for
the rendezvous of Perkin Warbeck’s army from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michell’s Mount, which he had also raised to the number
of six thousand in opposition to King Henry the
Seventh, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1498, as the pretended Richard of
Shrewsbury, second son to King Edward the Fourth;
where he was proclaimed King of England and France,
and Lord of Ireland, by the name of Richard the
Fourth: but he and his army at length underwent the
same fate as the former rebels did. (See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s
Mount, in this our History.)</p>

<p>Here also was the rendezvous of the Cornish rebels
under Humphrey Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> anno 3 Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
who pitched their camp upon Castle Kynock aforesaid,
and imprisoned such gentlemen as would not willingly
ride with them, till the King’s forces vanquished the
one, and delivered the other, at and near Exeter. (See
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hillary.)</p>

<p>Now Sir Anthony Kingston, Provost Martial of the
King’s Army, coming from Exeter to do justice in Cornwall
according to the law of arms against such rebels
as had escaped thence, executed Thomas Boyeer, the
mayor of this town, and the miller’s man, is set forth
in Mr. Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 124 (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 292 of
Lord Dunstanville’s Edition).</p>

<p>In this parish is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence, so called from the chapel
dedicated to his guardianship. The name is derived
from the Latin words, laureat and ensis, that is, a laureat
sword, or a sword of triumph. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence was a
native of Osca, in Spain, born about the year 280. He
received holy orders from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Xysten, who was raised to
the chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter in 257. During the persecution
by the Emperor Valerian, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence, finding that
not even the sacred vestments nor the decorations of
the church were safe from profane hands, availed himself
<!--127.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
of the office of chief deacon, which he then held, to
dispose of the whole, and to distribute the wealth thus
acquired among the indigent of his spiritual brethren.
This having been made known to the Prefect of
Rome, a man devoted to the worship of false gods, but
more, as the biographer observes, to the adoration of
silver and gold, he demanded from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence the
riches of the church, who promised in three days to
produce them; and on the third day he returned with
the poor persons among whom their value had been
divided. When the Prefect, transported with rage, is
said to have ordered his destruction by the most cruel
death. The legend reports him to have been fastened
on an iron bed, and consumed by fire placed under it.
Hence the familiar emblem attributed to this martyr,
of a gridiron. The event is referred to the 10th of
<abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr> 261.</p>

<p>In this parish the town, or rather village of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence,
is situated between two hills, and with a pleasant
river running through its street, about a mile and a half
west from Bodmin. In it stands a lawres hospital, that
is to say, a hospital for lepers (loure, or lower, in British
is a leper), which hath good endowment of lands and
revenues appertaining thereto, founded by the piety and
charity of the well-disposed people of this county in former
ages, for the relief, support, and maintenance of all
such people as should be visited with that sickness
called elphantiasy, in Latin lepra or elphantia, in
English leprosy, in British lowerery; being a white infectious
scurf running all over the bodies of such persons
as are tainted therewith. Which disease heretofore
in many families was hereditary, and infected the blood
for generations.</p>

<p>This disease, though common in Asia, was thought to
have been first brought into England from Egypt by
seamen and traders, so that generally it spread itself
over this kingdom about the year 1100. Soon after
<!--128.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
which, a general collection of charitable benevolences
was gathered throughout the land by one of the Mowbrays,
a gentleman tainted with the disease, for erecting
and endowing the lazar-house or hospital of Burton, in
Leicestershire, to which place was made subject all
other hospitals of this sort in England, as the Master of
Burton Hospital was afterwards made subject to the
Master of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Hospital of Jerusalem, in London,
and then, soon after the erection of lazar-houses throughout
this kingdom, was invented that writ called Leproso
amovendo, for removing a leper from his country-house
to the hospital. But the custom in this place was such,
that none were to be admitted by the governors of the
same for the time being, unless the person so brought
in paid them 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> a pot for dressing their meat, a purse
and a penny in it to receive alms. At present I hear of no
lepers in this hospital, nor any person visited with this
disease in Cornwall: however, daily in the chapel of
Lawrence, by the townspeople, God is duly worshipped
by a chaplain in deacon’s orders, who reads divine service
to them according to the church of England; and
at three several times at least in the year the Vicar of
Bodmin, and Rector of Lannerat, for a small stipend
preach and administer the sacraments to them. Infants
baptized, and the dead bodies thereof buried, at Bodmin
church.</p>

<p>The lands, customs, and privileges of this
lazar-house,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
or lower hospital, were much augmented or enlarged,
and also confirmed by a charter from Queen Elizabeth,
in the beginning of her reign, with the jurisdiction of a
court-leet within the precincts of its manor of Ponteby,
(id est, by the ford or bridge whereon the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lawrence is situate,) the white-rod erected or held up
yearly whilst the court is sitting. It is also by that
charter privileged with a weekly market, to be kept on
Wednesday, within the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence, though of
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>
late discontinued; as also with fairs yearly on the 10th
of August and the 18th of October.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>In respect to the etymology of the name Bodmin, or
Bodman, I have no difficulty. I looke upon the word
as Saxon-Kernawish, bode and man, or bode-men in the
plural, which may safely, and without a catachræsis, be
interpreted, the preacher-man, or men. That bode signifies
priest, or preacher, in the Cornish, the Gaelic, and
other cognate tongues, I confirm by the authority of
Alfred, the Saxon grammarian, and of Verstegan, from
which is derived our modern Kernawish word for a priest.</p>

<p>And this sense is preserved in the names of divers
other churches throughout the land; as in the hundred
of Weston, Herefordshire, where we find Boddenham
Vicarage, bod-den-ham, preacher-man-dwelling, den

<p>[The remainder of Mr. Tonkin’s narrative agrees so
nearly with that of Mr. Hals as not to require its insertion.]</p>

<p class="p2 center small">WHITAKER.</p>

<p>“The paroch chirch standith at the est end of the
town, and is a fair large thyng,” says Leland, an author
with whom Mr. Hals had no acquaintance (though the
Itinerary of that author was published in 1710, and in
some years immediately following; and the Collectanea
in 1715); “there is a cantuarie chapel at th’est ende
of it.” This is the present school, situated a few yards
east of the eastern end, raised upon vaults, ascended by
steps, entered by an arched door of stone peaked,
<!--130.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
having a large arched window peaked; at the east two
windows in the arch, two on the south, arched and
peaked; with three stalls of stone on the south, near the
eastern end. The space below, lately a bone-house to the
church, now atttached to the school, must formerly
have been a walk under the vault.</p>

<p>“Bodmyn hath a market on every Saturday, lyke a fair
for the confluence of people.” (<abbr title="Itinerary two">Itin. ii.</abbr> 114.) Bodmin was
then at the height of its glory: it began soon afterwards
to sink. The many decayed houses, says Carew, 120
years afterwards, prove the town to have been once
very populous. What occasioned this decay was the
Reformation, probably, throwing the revenues of the
priory, and of the house of friars, into the hands of men
laical and distant.</p>

<p>“There was a good place of Gray Freres in the south
syde of Bodmin town. One John of London, a merchaunt,
was the beginner of this house. Edmund Erle
of Cornewaul augmentid it. There lay buried in the
Gray Freres Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas Peverel,
Knightes, and benefactors to the house.”&mdash;(Leland.)
The remains of this form the south side of an open
space, which must have been the quadrangle or
court of the Friars, and have been surrounded by its
buildings, on the east, the north, and the west. On the
west end, near the grand door in these remains, was the
church-yard, or burying-place, which Mr. Hals says was
made a fair for cattle; and here were very lately found,
by sinking a saw-pit, bones in a considerable quantity.</p>

<p>The remains themselves are, a long and lofty room,
once a church, but since used as Mr. Hals describes.
It has a fine window at the east end, peaked in the arch;
the only part of it that is not blocked up being very
pleasingly broken into small parts by mullions of stone.</p>

<p>It has another arch for a window to the west, but
not so fine; and four arches on the north and south
sides, all peaked, but those most easterly more sharply
<!--131.png--><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pageno">93</span>
than the others. What Mr. Hals calls a font is still
there; and a font it assuredly is, the Friars having just
as much right to a font as to a burying-place; but the
inscription upon it is on two or three squares of the
hexagon in which the font is shaped, and is too modern
to mean any thing.</p>

<p>“There is a chapel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> &mdash;&mdash; at the west ende of
the toune. There is another chapel in Bodmyn beside
that at the west ende of the toune, and an almose house,
but not endowid with landes.” (Leland, <abbr title="Itinerary two">Itin. ii.</abbr> 114,
115.) Query, says Tanner, respecting the latter,
Whether this alms-house was <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony’s or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
George’s? for the will of John Killigrew, proved A.D.
1500, gives legacies <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pauperibus Sancti Antonii de Bodmyn,
et Pauperibus Sancti Georgii de Bodmyn</span>. Both
these chapels had an almshouse. The latter is that
chapel which stood on the summit of a hill north
of Bodmin, called Berry, from some castle or fort upon
it, I suppose, and giving name to the valley below it,
Berrycoomb, or Bereum. The remains of this chapel
are merely a tower, neat but slight, making a considerable
object to the road from its elevation, yet small in
its rise, or its pitch, and carrying a face of no great antiquity,
being merely three hundred years old. The
town, says tradition, stood formerly here, was burnt
down, and then removed to its present site. That this
is false as history we know for certain, as we know the
town to have been where it now stands, but that the
town in the days of its high prosperity had shot out
hither.</p>

<p>“The showe and the principale of the toun of Bodmyn,”
says Leland, “is from west to est along in one
streate.” (<abbr title="Itinerary two">Itin. ii.</abbr> 114.) There were (says Mr. Hals upon
the credit of information) within these sixty years past
no less than thirteen churches, or free chapels, remaining
either whole or ruined in the town and parish, and this
was one.</p>

<p><!--132.png--><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pageno">94</span>
The church of the priory, notes Mr. Hals, after the
dissolution of religious houses, was converted to a parochial
church. It was, indeed, such from the beginning:
so Leland tells us concerning it in his time, “that the
parish church standeth at the east end of the town,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
It was even converted as such from a rectorial to a vicarial
church before 1290.</p>

<p>This prioral rectory church, Mr. Hals himself informs
us, (long before the dissolution, and therefore not after
the dissolution of the priory, as said before,) was converted
by the Prior into a vicarage church; for in the
Inquisitions of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester,
Ecclesia de Bodman was rated to the Pope’s annats at
6<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> Vicar. ejusdem nihil propter paupertatem. So
directly does Mr. Hals confute himself; but the words of
the record are not cited fairly, and are in reality these:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0">Ecclesia de Bodmynia <abbr title="six">vi</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>

  <div class="i0">Vicar. ejusdem <abbr title="eleven">xi</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Nor could any one of the thirteen be a free chapel, as
no such chapels existed in the first or in the second
valuation, and therefore none are mentioned therein.</p>

<p>Vivian’s “tomb is adorned round with crosses.” In
truth, it has only one, and that is upon the northern side.
“The arms of his Bishopric of Megara,” the arms of
this Priory, and lastly, “those of his own or of his ancestors.”
But there are three fishes repeated as arms
twice; and Mr. Hals affirms himself that the jurisdiction
and royalty over the river Alan, from Camelford to
Padstow Rock, was given to this Priory by Algar Earl
of Cornwall; and in further testimony of Algar’s donation
of the royalty of this river, he gave for the perpetual
arms of him and his priory, In a field Azure, three
salmon-fishes in fess barwise Argent; which arms were
lately extant in all the church windows of the churches
under the priory.</p>

<p>Castle Kynock, as called by some to this day, but called
simply the Castle by the generality, lies more than half
<!--133.png--><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>
a mile to the south-west, has two ditches and two ramparts;
the outer are very deep and very massy, the
inner are much shallower and slighter. It takes in the
whole crest of the hill, the ground within rising from
the sides to the summit; is circular in form, because the
hill is so; and has its only entrance on the east, denoted
as an original entrance by the bridge of earth, as it
were, which leads across the hollow of the ditches into
it. The whole is double, I believe, to the extent that
Mr. Hals gives it; and, from the position of the entrance
on the east, appears to be Roman in its origin.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to enter on any discussion relative
to the remote and obscure antiquity of Bodmin.
Tanner, in his Notitia Monasticon, says Bodmin, or
Bodmanna.</p>

<p>There was a church built here to the memory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petroc, a religious man born in Wales, but who, coming
from Ireland, is said to have built a monastery on the
north coast of Cornwall, about A.D. 520, and to have
been there buried; but his body being afterwards removed
to Bodmin, a church was built to his memory,
and the episcopal see for Cornwall was believed to have
been therein placed by King Edward the Elder and
Archbishop Plegmund, A.D. 705. Here King Æthelstan
is reported to have met with old Saxon, or rather
British, monks following the Rule of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict, to
whom he granted so great privileges and endowments
that he is accounted founder of the monastery here,
about A.D. 926. That settlement was destroyed by the
Danish pirates, A.D. 981; yet the religious continued
here under several shapes, and much alienation of their
lands, both before and after the Conquest, till about the
year 1120, when Earl Algar, with the King’s license,
and the consent of William Warlewach, Bishop of
Exeter, re-established this religious-house, and placed
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
therein regular canons of the Order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin, who
continued till the general suppression, when it was styled
the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc, and was valued
at 270<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum according to Dugdale, and
289<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
according to Speed. The site, with the demesnes, were
granted, 36th of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> to Thomas Sternhold, one
of the first translators of the Psalms into English metre.</p>

<p>Any one desirous of learning all that can be known or
conjectured respecting the Western Bishopric, is referred
to “The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall historically
surveyed,” by the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Whitaker; where
that subject and various others are discussed, with the
eloquence, ability, erudition, and confidence, usually
displayed by that eminent writer; who appears always to
assume throughout the whole of his work the very questionable
fact, that monastic historians, distant both in
time and in space from the events which they relate, are
possessed of perfect information, and that their narratives
flow with unerring accuracy, at a period when none
of the inventions for rapidly carrying intelligence, and
for stamping it with the authentic impression of public
notoriety, had yet occurred to the human mind.</p>

<p>I willingly leave these recondite, and, in truth, little
interesting researches, for others of a more modern date,
the objects of which are still extant, and their effects influencing
the present times. Those connected with Bodmin
we owe, in a great measure, to the ability, the industry,
and the laudable zeal of Mr. John Wallis, the
present vicar, on whom I would readily bestow more
praise, if his merits had not rendered commendation
from me superfluous.</p>

<p>One event, however, intermediate between the Saxon
antiquities of Bodmin and those disclosed by Mr. Wallis,
is so very curious, and so illustrative of opinions and
of habits long passed away, that I cannot help inserting
the details of it from Benedictus Abbas, an author of
high reputation, Abbot of the great monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<p>Which may be thus translated:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the same year (1177), immediately after the Epiphany
of our Lord, a certain Canon of the Abbey of
Bodmin, in Cornwall, by name Martinus, secretly took
away the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc. Flying with it, he passed
beyond the seas, and carried the body to the Abbey of
Saint Mevennus, in Lesser Britany.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When this transaction became known to Roger the
Prior of Bodmin, and to the Canons who served God in
the same place, the aforesaid Prior, with the advice of
his brethren, went to Henry King of England, son of
the Empress Matilda, that by his powerful aid they
might again get possession of the body of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petroc, of
which they had been fraudulently deprived. The King
granted his aid to their entreaty, and by his letters commanded
Rollandus de Dinamnus, the Justiciary of Britanny,
that, without any delay, he should cause the
body to be restored. When, therefore, Rollandus had
received the King’s command, he came with a powerful
and armed band to the Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mevennus, and
ordered that the body should be given up; and when the
<!--137.png--><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>
Abbat and the Monks were unwilling to comply, he
added threats, that, unless the body were yielded immediately,
he would use force and take it; which when
they heard, they feared to incur the displeasure of the
King of England, and therefore restored that blessed
body to the before-named Roger, Prior of Bodmin, on
the Lord’s Day (Clausi Pentecostes), being the feast of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gervasius and of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Prothasius, martyrs, the thirteenth
before the calends of July (June the 19th). And
that sacred body was restored in all its integrity, without
the least diminution; the Abbat and Monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mevennus having sworn on the relics belonging to their
church that they had not retained any part of the body,
but had restored it wholly unaltered.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When this was done, the before-named Prior of
Bodmin, returning with joy into England, brought the
body of the blessed Petroc, closed in an ivory case, to
the City of Winchester. And when it was brought into
the King’s presence, the King, having seen and adored
it, permitted the Prior to return in peace with his Saint
charge to the Abbey of Bodmin.”</p>

<p>It would appear that such depredations must have
frequently occurred, since one precisely similar, but not
followed by a restoration of the relics, took place in the
neighbouring monastery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot. In this case, the
stolen body of the Saint, having been enshrined at
Eynesbury, in Huntingdonshire, bestowed his name as
a new appellation to the place. See “A Description,
accompanied by sixteen coloured plates, of the Church
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot, in Cornwall,” by J. P. Hedgeland, 1 <abbr title="volume quarto">vol.
4to.</abbr> 1830, with Illustrations by Davies Gilbert.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallis has collected a very great variety of
curious and interesting particulars respecting this town
and parish, and given them to the public in a work entitled,
“The Bodmin Register; or, Collections relative
to the past and present State of the Parish of Bodmin.”
And, in doing so, he has proved that the antiquities of a
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
county cannot in any way be illustrated, except by the
exertions of individuals locally residing in the district to
which their attentions are directed, and that from zeal
and ability in such persons every thing may be expected.</p>

<p>The following are extracts from this publication:</p>

<p>The benefice is a vicarage in the gift of Lord de Dunstanville,
situated in the Deanery of Trigg Minor, and
in the hundred of Trigg. The following are the dimensions
of the church: length 151 feet, breadth 63 feet.
The greater part was built in the reign of King Edward
the Fourth. It was roofed in 1472, as appears by an
inscription on the cornice on the northern side of the
south aile of the chancel. The northern chancel and
the tower appear to be of an earlier date. The walls of
the tower are eight feet thick at the base, made for the
support of a lofty spire, which was destroyed by lightning,
between seven and eight o’clock on Saturday evening,
December the 9th, 1699. The present awkward
pinnacles were then erected: three of them are dangerous
from the decay of the stone.</p>

<p>The ancient building in the church-yard, adjoining to
the vicarage-house, was, it is believed, a chantry chapel
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas. The interior, 44 feet 9 inches
by 19 feet, was used till lately for the free grammar-school.
It is now converted to a national school for
girls. Under is a crypt or bone-house.</p>

<p>The isolated tower at Berry, on the north of the town,
belonged to the chapel of the Holy Rood. The building
of this tower was commenced on the 12th of September,
17th of King Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> 1501.</p>

<p>Since the year 1814, both the church and church-yard,
which were in a very ruinous and neglected state, have
been greatly altered and improved.</p>

<p>Over the porch are the remains of two small rooms,
each about eleven feet square, formerly the record and
the council rooms of the corporation. The floor of the
higher one, the record room, gave way about eighty
<!--139.png--><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pageno">101</span>
years ago, as some gentlemen were inspecting the documents.
In the lower room some valuable records had
remained for a long time neglected, till in the year 1807
or 1808 they were removed to the guild-hall, and there
examined and arranged. They contain many curious
particulars relative to the history of the parish, and incidentally
of the county, during a period of five hundred
years, the oldest document bearing date in the 14th
Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (1320). Among them is a charter of the
36th Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> (1362); another, in good preservation,
of the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> year of Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (1380), having reference to
the reigns of Henry the First and Second. A minute of
the receipts and payments for the rebuilding of the
church, in the years 1469, 1470, and 1471; and also for
the erection of Berry Tower, in 1501; the contract
with Matthy More, carpenter, for making the pulpit and
open seats throughout the church in 1491, the carved
remains of which are at present much admired; Resolutions
of the Corporation on the destruction of the spire
in 1699; also a Petition to King Henry the Eighth, on
the eve of the Reformation, conveying some ludicrous
charges against the Prior; with various others.</p>

<p>In the north chancel is the altar-tomb of Prior Vivian,
the inscription on which has been inserted in page 76.
The tomb was repaired, and placed between two pillars
of the chancel, in 1819, by the late Sir Vyell Vyvyan, of
Trelowarren.</p>

<p>The very splendid organ was given, in the year 1775,
by Mr. James Laroche and Mr. George Hunt, at that
time Members for the town.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallis enters into a very minute detail of particulars
highly interesting to the immediate neighbourhood,
but which would occupy too much space in a
general parochial history of Cornwall.</p>

<p>The carving in the church is indeed greatly admired,
but a large part of that admiration is excited by the
appropriate and judicious manner in which it has been
rendered ornamental by the present vicar.</p>

<p><!--140.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pageno">102</span>
The inscriptions on various monuments are noticed
by Lysons, and other writers.</p>

<p>But a splendid addition has been recently made to
the decorations of the church by Lord De Dunstanville,
on his retiring from the office of recorder in the
corporation. The large east window of the chancel is
entirely filled with painted glass, and the middle part
contains a well-drawn representation of the Ascension.</p>

<p>Bodmin parish contains 5279 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY.</p>

<p>Dr. Boase says of the Geology: the town of Bodmin
is about midway between two insulated groups of granite,
and it is principally built of a stone quarried on
the spot, and which well deserves the attention of geologists.
This rock in the deeper parts of the quarry
becomes more blue; but its common appearance presents
various shades of drab or fawn colour, with irregular
spots of an ochreous yellow. It breaks into thick

so that, with care, this stone may be obtained in oblong

so as to lose its cohesion. The substance appears to be

All the cultivated parts of this parish, north and
north-west of the town, rest on this rock: and the barren
parts on a schistose rock, which is very siliceous, affording
by its partial disintegration no more than a shallow,
meagre soil; silica predominating in the one, and argillaceous
earth, or alumine, in the other. The characteristic
rocks of these genera occur next to the granite in
the parishes of Blisland and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward, and they will
be noticed in the description of the latter parish.</p>

<p>The editor is aware that the article Bodmin has extended
to a very great length. It might easily have
been extended much further from interesting materials
collected by Mr. Wallis relative to the past and present
state of this chief seat of our ecclesiastical establishments.
On their abolition the town unquestionably fell
into great decay, till about the middle of the last century,
when roads were made in all directions, and Bodmin,
from being almost inaccessible by the modern system
of travelling, became an extensive thoroughfare;
the market has grown into one of the first in Cornwall,
and the whole town is renovated by trade and industry.</p>

<p>If any further apology is required, the editor hopes
that he may be excused for some partiality towards a
place which he has represented in eight successive Parliaments,
after as many unanimous elections.</p>

<!--142.png--><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
for the second name, it signifies “Flemings,” making
amends, or supplying defects (see Verstegan on the word
Bote), and seems from the name to be a church founded
or endowed by some gentlemen of that name, in order
for the commutation of penance for sins committed, and
to pray for the founder’s soul, his ancestors, and relatives;
by which expedients most religious houses and
churches heretofore were built. Originally these Flemings
came from Stoke Fleming in Devon, so called, for
that once a nobleman of Flanders resided there, and was
lord thereof: one of whose posterity, tempore Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
in this place, held by the tenure of knight’s service seven
knights’ fees, by the name of Stephen Flandrensis (Carew’s
Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48), who probably was the
founder of this church, still bearing his name. His son
Richard Flandrensis was sheriff of Cornwall three years,
from the third to the sixth year of King John’s reign.
Finally, the estate, name, and blood of those Flemings,
tempore Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> ended in a daughter and heir,
which was married to John Coplestone, of Coplestone,
in the county of Devon.</p>

<p>This district of Bote-Fleming, at the time of the
Norman Conquest, was rated under the name of Pillaton,
still contiguous therewith. But at the time of the

into the value of benefices in Cornwall 1294, in order to
the Pope’s annats, Ecclesia de Bote-fflemmen in Decanatu

<p>Mutten-ham, id est, the Mutton dwelling or habitation,
alias Mott-an-ham, the meeting or court
dwelling, in the year 1689 was the dwelling of my
kind friend John Waddon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (a justice of peace and
deputy-governor of Pendennis Castle for King James,
under John Earl of Bath); in which house and place
his lordship first treated with the Prince of Orange’s
Commissioners, in order to render into his possession the
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
castles of Pendennis and Plymouth, which soon after
was performed, on condition of the Earl’s holding his
former dominion as governor of those places under him;
whereupon he caused the Prince’s declarations to be first
proclaimed or published in those garrisons amongst the
soldiers; who received and heard the same with great
joy, shouts, and acclamations, to the utter destruction
of King James’s jurisdiction and power in Cornwall
and Devon, and establishing that prince’s.</p>

<p>At this time were dispersed those rhymes, said to be
made by father Peters:</p>

<p class="unindent">The dispersion of which two papers, made all possessors
of church lands and impropriators, together with
all rectors and vicars of churches in Cornwall (except
Mr. Beauford of Lantegles, and Mr. Polwhele of Newland,)
to renounce their allegiance to King James, and
to take an oath of fealty to the Prince of Orange, after
his accession to the crown of England.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>I shall take leave to add this interpretation of the words
making up the name of this parish. Bote signifies help,
succour, aid, or advantage; as in Bridgebote, Burgbote,
Ploughbote, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and Fleming, from its ancient lords
the Flemings, which family was heretofore of good esteem
in this county. In the times of Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and of
Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, the Flemings are recorded as having large
possessions in Cornwall.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The following very extraordinary occurrence has taken
place with respect to the estate of Hatt in this parish.</p>

<p><a name="Symons" id="Symons"></a>A brother of the last Mr. William Symons went
through his clerkship as an attorney with Mr. Rashleigh
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell. He there formed an attachment to
a respectable young woman, but in a situation of life so
much inferior to his own as to excite a violent opposition
against this marriage on the part of his friends.
In consequence Mr. Symonds suddenly disappeared; no
trace could be discovered, nor was any information received
about him, either by his relations or by the deserted
object of his affection.</p>

<p>The elder brother died unmarried, and his sisters or
their families took possession of his property; till, about
forty years after Mr. Symonds had left Cornwall, a young
man claimed the whole as his eldest son, and finally substantiated
his claim by the verdict of a jury, and to the
entire satisfaction of a full court. His father had disappeared
about the year 1780; he had employed himself
in various humble, but not disreputable occupations,
married, and finally settled in Liverpool, where
he was accidentally drowned. His family then first
acquired, from inspecting his papers, any knowledge of
Cornwall, or of the stock from whence they were derived;
they found his articles of clerkship, with various
letters and documents, which placed his identity beyond
all doubt, and the son now possesses the manor house,
with a fair private gentleman’s estate.</p>

<p>This parish contains 995 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Boyton is situate in the hundred of Stratton, and hath
upon the east the Tamer River, south Warrington, north
Tamerton, west North Pedyrwyn, and as a mark of its
antiquity and grandeur it was taxed in the Domesday
Roll 1067 or 1087, by the present name. In the Inquisition
of the Bishop of Lincoln and Winchester before-mentioned,
Capella de Boyeton, in Decanatu de Stratone,
was rated <abbr title="thirty">xxx</abbr><span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> but whether rectory or vicarage I
am ignorant; the same not being mentioned either in
Wolsey’s Inquisition or Valor Beneficiorum. The patronage

This parish rated to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound Land Tax, 1696,
£89. 14<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>Most probable it seems to me, that this place was denominated
Boyton in memory of a colony of the Boii
Gauls, that out of that country of Gaul first planted
themselves here; who were a people on the further side
of the Rhine, that with the Helvetians first invaded
Gaul, as Cæsar informs us, and placed themselves
amongst the Hedui, a people of Gallia Celtica, near the
Loire River, and possessed a great part of Burgundy;
Cæsar also makes Boia in Gaul the name of a town.</p>

<p>Bradridge in this parish, the broad ridge or farrow
of land (Saxon), is the dwelling of John Hoblyn,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> barrister at law, son of Mr. Hoblyn, attorney at
law, of Bodmin; which place came to this gentleman
by marriage with the sole daughter and heir of William
Symons, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney at law, as it did to him by marriage
with the daughter and heir of Heale.</p>

<p>The Heales’ arms are, Party per fess Argent and
Sable, a pole counterchanged with three trefoils, one on
each side the pole in chief, and the other thereon, in
base counterchanged.</p>

At Northcott, in this parish, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Queen Mary, lived
Agnes Prest, but where born, or what her maiden name
was, is to me unknown, whose merit challengeth to be
recorded in this place, as being the only martyr that
suffered death for the Protestant religion in the diocese
of Exon during the said Queen’s reign. She is described
by Holinshed, Howell, alias Hooker, and by Fuller
from them, to be a contemptible woman in respect of
her person, (as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul was for a man,) little, and short
of stature, and of a brownish complexion. She was indicted,
as Mr. Vowell says, at Launceston, in this county,
upon Monday the fourth week in Lent, the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> and <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of
Philip and Mary, before the Grand Jury there assembled.
The matter suggested in the Bill was: “For that she
denied the Real Presence in the sacrament of the altar;
and for saying the same was but a sign and figure of
Christ’s body; and that no Christian doth eat the body
of Christ carnally, but spiritually.” The evidence against
her were her own husband and children; from whom
she fled, for that they would compel her, by force, to be
present at the celebration of mass. Notwithstanding,
upon their testimonies the bill was found, and indorsed,
“Billa vera.” Whereupon she came to her trial before
William Starford, then Justice of Assize, (probably he
that wrote the Pleas of the Crown,) where, upon a full
hearing of the case, the Petty Jury also found her guilty,
on the testimony aforesaid; after which she was presented
to James Turbervill, Bishop of Exeter, for further
examination on the premises, but she persisting in her
former opinion, was by him condemned as a heretic.</p>

<p>After her condemnation, she refused to receive any
money from well-disposed people, that formerly relieved
her, saying, she was going to that City where money
had no mastery. Soon after she was delivered over to
the secular power to be burnt, to Robert Cary, of Cockington,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then Sheriff of Devonshire, or to his Under
Sheriff, who saw her executed at Southernhay, without
the walls of Exon, in the 54th year of her age, and in
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pageno">109</span>
the month of November, 1558. This was the only person
in whose persecution Bishop Turbervill did appear,
in matters of religion, during the time he sat in that see,
(consecrated <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 8, 1555, deprived in January 1560,)
and, as Dr. Fuller saith, her death was procured more
by the violence of Blackston, the Chancellor, than by
any persecution of the Bishop.</p>

<p>And here it may not be impertinent to show, that our
ancestors the Britons of Cornwall received and took
the blessed Sacrament in the same sense as this martyr
Agnes Prest did receive it; that is by faith only, contrary
to the doctrine of Transubstantiation: as is evident
from Mount Calvary, a manuscript in verse in the
Cornish tongue, written about five hundred years since,
a copy of which is now in my own custody, which containeth
the history of the Incarnation and Passion of
Christ, according to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Gospel; wherein,
amongst others, verse the 79th containeth these
words:<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span></p>

Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1050, Berengarius, a deacon of Angiers
in France, disproved and refuted the doctrine of Transubstantiation
in a large manuscript, which he sent with
letters to Lanfrank, then Abbat of Caen in Normandy,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury from 1070 to 1089,
which letters and reasons, in the absence of Lanfrank,
being opened by some of his clergy, the same were transmitted
to Pope Leo <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> whereupon calling a council at
Rome, and the letters and reasons of Berengarius being
read, he was condemned for an heretic in 1051. In
France also the same year, Pope Leo <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> assembled another
council at Versailles against Berengarius, which
likewise condemned him for a heretic. The like did
Victor <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> successor of Pope Leo <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> in 1055, in which
council Berengarius answered personally for himself;
That, as to the doctrine he taught concerning the Sacrament,
he adhered to no particular opinion of his own,
but to that which was the ancient and common doctrine
of the universal Church.</p>

<p>After Pope Victor <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> his successor Pope Nicholas <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
assembled at Rome a council of a hundred and thirteen
Bishops against Berengarius’ doctrine; who thereupon
submitted the same to the Pope and his councils’ correction,
who prescribed him a form of recantation. But
afterwards he published a refutation of that recantation,
and of the doctrines therein contained, anno 1059.
Notwithstanding which, the fourth council of Lateran,
under Pope Innocent <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in 1160, (Frederick <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> being
then Emperor), consisting of four hundred bishops and
holy fathers, established the Roman doctrine of Transubstantiantion,
which was afterwards further confirmed
by another council at Lateran, in Rome, under Pope
Innocent <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> <abbr title="anno Domini">an. Dom.</abbr> 1215.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>The etymology of this name, Boyeton, may be either
from the Cornish word “byu,” which is pronounced like
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pageno">111</span>
“boy,” or from the French “bois,” a wood, which agrees
extremely well with its situation in the midst of woods.</p>

<p>I take most if not all the parish to be a part of or
holden from the manor of Boyton, which belonged to
the Priory of Launceston, and was ultimately given,
inter alia, by King Henry the Eighth, to the Duchy of
Cornwall, in exchange for the honour of Wallingford.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>For a detailed account of Berengarius, see Le Grand
Dictionaire Historique, par Moreri, under the word Berenger,
who refers to a great variety of authorities.</p>

<p>The account given of Agnes Prest is curious, if she
alone suffered in the whole diocese of Exeter during
Queen Mary’s persecution. They still exhibit at Exeter
the place of her martyrdom, and are persuaded that
grass has refused to grow on the spot ever since.</p>

been removed to Bradock. The united parishes are
now in the presentation of Lord Grenville.</p>

<p>Bradock down was the scene of two important events
in the civil war.</p>

<p><!--151.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pageno">113</span>
First, a victory obtained by the King’s forces early in
<a name="err12" id="err12"></a>1623 under the command of Sir Bevill Granville, Sir
Nicholas Glenning, Sir Ralph Hopton, Arundell, Trevanion,
and other gentlemen of the county, over a much
larger force commanded by Ruthven, Governor of Plymouth.
The victory was so complete that Ruthven
with difficulty reached Saltash, accompanied by a few
only of his troops, from whence they were speedily
driven across the Tamar; and this advantage mainly
contributed to the more splendid victory at Stratton,
obtained on the 16th of May of the same year; a victory
which, rolling on its tide of success through Devonshire
and Somersetshire, over Lansdowne and Bristol,
might have swept the whole of England but for the
recoil of its waves from the walls of Gloucester.</p>

<p>The second event was on a more extensive scale.</p>

<p>Lord Essex having conducted a large army into
Cornwall, was followed by the King in person, till
they approached so near that the King had his head
quarters at Boconnoc, and Lord Essex at Lanhidrock,
when, after various skirmishes and proposals for negotiation
on the part of the King, Lord Essex at last, on
the 30th or 31st of August 1644, accompanied by Lord
Robartes, and some other officers, abandoned his army,
and reached Plymouth by sea; and on the same day
Sir William Belfour, with <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Nicholas Boscowen,
<abbr title="Liutenant Colonel">Lieut.-Col.</abbr> James Hals, of Merther, Henry Courtenay,
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bennet’s in Lanivet, <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> John Sentaubyn of
Clawanar, his <abbr title="Liutenant Colonel">Lieut.-Col.</abbr> Briddon, <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Carter, and others
of the horde of two thousand five hundred cavalry,
forced their passage through the King’s army, over <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Winnow, Boconnoc, and Bradock Downs, to Saltash,
and from thence to Plymouth. Their escape is
said to have been mainly owing to the negligence of
General Goring, whose ill conduct and exactions in
Cornwall, have left his name as a term of severe reproach
up to the present time.</p>

<p><!--152.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
After these discouraging events, Major-<abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Skippon
found himself in command of the infantry, for whom he
obtained a favourable capitulation, the particulars of
which may be seen in Lord Clarendon’s History, and
they are given by Mr. Hals, from whose statement the
above is chiefly abridged.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals adds a circumstance illustrative of the animosity
excited by internal dissensions; and, as his
feelings and opinions were all on the royal side, the
narrative may be esteemed deserving of credit.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the articles, the disarmed soldiers of
the Parliament, as they marched by the King and his
army on Boconnoc and Bradock Downs, and elsewhere,
were barbarously slaughtered and shot upon by
the King’s soldiers, so that many perished thereby,
others were stripped comparatively naked, and robbed
of their money, others had their horses taken from
them; whereupon Major-General Skippon, with undaunted
courage, rode up to the King’s troop, and told
him personally of the injury and violence offered, and
the slaughter of his men, contrary to the articles, which
in such cases were kept inviolable by all nations of
men; and therefore prayed the King to be just, and to
prohibit those barbarities of his soldiers for the future,
which the King forthwith commanded to be done. But
his word and authority were little regarded while his
army were in sight of the Parliamentary soldiers.</p>

<p>This total discomfiture of Lord Essex’s army left the
King without an enemy in arms through the whole of
Cornwall, and a letter is preserved in the hands of Lord
Dunstanville from his ancestor Sir Francis Basset, respecting
the last words addressed to him by the King:
“Mr. Sheriff, I leave the county entirely at peace in
your hands.”</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head"><abbr title="Saint">ST.</abbr> BREOCK.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock is situate in the hundred of Pyder, and
hath upon the north <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Issy; east, Wadebridge on the
Alan river; south, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Wenn and Withiel; west, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Columb Major.</p>

<p>The name is derived from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock or Briock, the
patron of this church, of one in the island of Guernsey,
and perhaps of Breage near Helston.</p>

<p>This <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock was a native of Ireland, born at Cork
about the fifth century. A man famous in his day, for
the most strenuous support of the orthodox faith in
opposition to Arianism, the heresy at that time distracting
the Latin Church. He was bishop of a diocese in
Armorica, now called Britany, where the place of his
residence is at this day distinguished by his name.</p>

<p>This parish does not appear in the Bishop of Lincoln’s
valuation; but in that of Wolsey it is rated at
41<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 10<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>

<p><!--154.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pageno">116</span>
In the Domesday survey this parish was rated under
the district of Pelton or Penpow, now Powton.</p>

<p>This Powton was the voke lands of a manor given to
the See of our Cornish Bishop; afterwards to the Bishop
of Kirton, and then to Exeter; finally to the Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petroc at Bodmin. After the dissolution of monasteries,
this barton, together with the extensive manor to which
it belonged, passed through a great variety of hands by
sale, so that Mr. Hals says the manor had sixteen lords
of different families in about sixty-two years; a mutability
not to be instanced in any other lands in Cornwall,
except Fentongellon in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell,
which also contained a religious house, but in 26
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> was converted to secular purposes.</p>

<p>This manor of Pelton has always possessed a court
leet, where writs might be entertained without any
limit of amount; but, the lord of the manor having suffered
from various escapes of persons confined for debt,
the prison, and with it the judicial functions of the
court, have been discontinued. Sir William Morice,
the secretary of state and friend of General Monk, acquired
this manor by purchase. His second daughter,
Barbara Morice, married Sir John Molesworth of <a name="penconnow" id="penconnow"></a>Penconnow,
and brought this property into that family,
where it still remains.</p>

<p>Hurston in this parish, which I take to be from the
Saxon, and to mean wood town, is still situated in a
wood, and formerly belonged to the Cormynews of Fentongellon.</p>

<p>Tredinick gave name and origin to an ancient family
of gentlemen. Christopher Tredinick was sheriff of
Cornwall in 22 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>; he gave for his arms, In
a field Or, on a bend Sable three bucks’ heads caboshed
Argent. His family and name are now, I take it, both
extinct. In the time of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> this property came
by purchase to Lord Robartes.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals adds a fanciful derivation of this name;
<!--155.png--><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
but since “doon” and “din” are well known to signify
a place tenable either by nature or art, and “ick” is
unquestionably water, Tre-din-ick will be either the fortified
town, or the hill town, near a river.]</p>

<p>Trevorder, meaning the further town, or the one most
distant; also Trevorder Bickin, the far-off beacon-town,
belonged to the Carmynews of Fentongellon, having
come to them by the heiress of Trenowith, as Trenowith
had acquired it by the heiress of Tregago. It
passed by sale from the Carmynews to Vyell, and
has subsequently split between six coheiresses, who
married Prideaux, Vyvyan, Dennis, Grensill, Rinden,
and Smith.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing worth inserting that
differs from Mr. Hals, except perhaps his etymology of
the name Dunveth, a place belonging once to Tredinick,
and situated near the churchyard, and therefore
named the hill of graves; beth being a grave in Welch
and Cornish, and the labials b and v perpetually changing
into each other.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>On the north and north-eastern parts of this parish, in
the vicinity of the Camel, the land is fertile, resting on
a rock which sometimes resembles a calcareous schist,
<!--156.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
but more commonly that kind of clay-slate which
abounds in the calcareous series. This slate at Penquean
splits into very thin leaves, and is then quarried
as a roofing slate, but is softer and has less lustre, and
is not so durable as that raised at Delabole near Camelford.
The south and south-western parts of the parish
consist of barren downs; the rock forming the substratum
is, however, very similar in appearance to what
occurs in the other division; but it contains more silex
and is less laminated, does not easily cleave, and is less
susceptible of decomposition than the former, and therefore
produces only a meagre, arenaceous soil.</p>

district of Treskeaw, that is to say the skeawe, or elder-tree
town, a place, as I am informed, well known and
still extant there.</p>

<p>In the pleas of the crown in the Exchequer, 12th
Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, I found it thus written of Pengelly in this
parish.</p>

<p><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Johannes de Treveally tenet in Pengelly, in comitatu
Cornubiæ, dimidium acram terræ Cornubiensem,
(above a hundred English,) per sergiantiam recipiendi
unam capam de grisando ad Pontem de Penleton, cum
Rex fuerit inveniendus versus Cornubiam; et intrando
Domino de Cabilla, qui eam in adventu domini Regis
ibidem deferre debet, et eam tradere eidem Johanni,
qui quidem Johannes eandem capam ferre debet cum
domino Rege pro totam in Cornubiam;”</span> which Mr.
Hals interprets, that the half acre Cornish is held by the
duty of its owner receiving a great coat from some one
in Devonshire at Penleton Bridge, and to carry it about
for the King’s use, so long as he remains in Cornwall.</p>

<p>In this parish stands the barton and manor of Good-ol-gan,
also God-al-gan, synonymous words, only varied
by the dialect, meaning a place that was altogether
a wood down, a name anciently given and taken from
the natural circumstances thereof. Otherwise, if the
name consist of English-Cornish, God-ol-gan signifies a
place that was altogether God’s downs. As for the
modern name Good-ol-phin, God-ol-fyn, it, in like manner
as the former, admits of no other etymology or construction
than that it was a place that was altogether a
wood, fountain, well, or spring of water, or altogether
God’s fountain or spring of water. But because the
words god, gud, good, in Cornish, Belgic, and British, are
always taken and adopted in the first sense, to signify
only a wood, and the words Du, Due, and Dyu, are the
proper appellations of God, and no other in Cornish, I
cannot apprehend how that sacred name is concerned
in the initial part of this word, Godolphin, which refers,
<!--158.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pageno">120</span>
as I said before, to the circumstances of the place, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
that no table, fountain, well, or spring of water here,
that passeth beneath the house, through the gardens,
and the woods and groves of timber that still surround
the same.</p>

<p>Contrary to this etymology, Mr. Carew, in his “Survey
of Cornwall,” page 153, says that godolphin signifies
a white eagle, than which nothing can be more
untrue; for, in all those compound words, there is
not one particle or syllable relating thereto, or any
other than the British language whatsoever: for wen
erew, wen eryr, wen eriew, and by contraction wen-er,
is a white eagle in the Welch, Little-Britannic, and
Cornish tongues. [See Dr. Davis’s British Lexicon,
and Floyd upon Aquila.] In like manner Verstegan
tells us, that, in the Saxon tongue, blond erna is a white
eagle; as also in the German and Dutch tongues; and
the French dictionaries inform us that blanch ægle, or
aegle, is a white eagle; ἀετος [aetos] in Greek; aquila,
in Latin; nesher in the Hebrew; from whence our
British erew, erier, eryr, eriew, is derived.</p>

<p>In opposition to all those etymologies of the word
godolphin, Mr. Sammes in his Britannia, and the author
of the additions to Camden’s Britannia, tells us that
godolac in the Phenician tongue signifies a land of
tin, from whence they apprehend the name of godolphin
is derived, especially because tin is found in the precincts
thereof, but surely not comparable in quantity to
what is made in forty other places in Cornwall, that yet
come not under that denomination of godolphin, as
being tin land.</p>

<p>From the name I proceed to the matter or thing itself,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the manor and barton of Godolphin; which
lands, in the time of Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, were the lands of Sir
John Lamburne, Knight, of Lamburne in Peransand,
whose daughter and heir was afterwards married to Sir
Renphry, or John Arundell, of Lanherne, Knight, one
<!--159.png--><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
of whose posterity, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Edmond Arundell, Knight, tempore
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> sold the same to one Stephens, upon
condition of a kind of domineering, lording, or insulting
tenure, and reservation of rent to his manor of Lamburne
in Peransand, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> “that once a year for ever the
Reeve of the said Manor should come to Godolphin,
and there boldly enter the hall, jump upon the table, or
table-board, and there stamp or bounce with his feet or
club, to alarm and give notice to the people of his approach,
and then and there make proclamation aloud
three times, ‘Oyes! oyes! oyes! I am the Reeve of
the Manor of Lamburne in Peransand, come here to
demand the old rent, duties, and customs, due to the
lords of the said Manor from the lands of Godolphin.’
Upon which notice there is forthwith to be brought him
2<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span> rent, a large quart of strong beer, a loaf of
wheaten bread worth sixpence, and a cheese of the like
value; which the Reeve having received, he shall drink
of the beer, taste the bread and cheese in the place, and
then depart, carrying with him the said rent and remainder
of those viands, to the lords of the Manor
aforesaid, to whom they are still duly paid, which at
present are Sir John Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and others, who
claim it in right of the two daughters and heirs of the
said Edmund Arundell, which were married to Danvers
and Whitington, as Whitington’s heirs were married to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn and others.</p>

<p>After Stephens purchased those lands of Godolphin
from Arundell, and came possessed thereof, his only
daughter and heir was married to Ralph Knava, or
Nava, of &mdash;&mdash;; which name or word is of quite
another signification in the British tongue than what it
signifies in the English; for knava, nava, nawe, naue,
signifies the same as servus, servulus, famulus, minister,
administer, ministrator, in Latin; hence it is that in
Trevisa’s and Tyndale’s translation of the Bible into
English, the word is used in this sense by them; Titus
<!--160.png--><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
<abbr title="one, verse">i, v.</abbr> 1, “Paul a knava of Jesus Christ;” and the like,
2nd Timothy, <abbr title="chapter one, verse">chap. i. v.</abbr> 1, “Paul a nava of Jesus
Christ;” which words, in the translation of the Bible in
James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>’s time, the translators have rightly rendered into
new English, by the names of “Paul, a servant of Jesus
Christ;” and “Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ;” that
is, a messenger, an ambassador, or servant, sent, as
apostolus; in the original Greek δουλος (doulos), servus
και et αποστολος (apostolus); and in all other places in
the Old and New Testament, where they met with the
Greek words doulos and apostolus, they are by them so
rendered.</p>

<p>From the British names nave, nava, nawe, knawe,
the old name or distinction of this tribe or family may
be plainly inferred, for that the first ancestor or progenitor
thereof was of a mere British extraction; a servant,
steward, ambassador, minister, or messenger of
God, Christ, his king, prince, or other master, (for those
words are all synonymous, only by the dialect varied
with the transposing of a vowel,) and is a name of office
of one that is a substitute or vicegerent, and acts under
another.</p>

<p>But more certain I am that John Knava, of Godolphin,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was struck Sheriff of Cornwall by King
Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, 1504, who declared his great liking of
that gentleman in all circumstances for the said
office, but discovered as much dislike of his name after
the English, not understanding the import thereof in
Cornish, and so further said, that, as he was pater patriæ,
he would transnominate him to Godolphin, whereof
he was lord; and accordingly caused or ordered that in
his letters patent under the broad seal of England, for
being Sheriff of Cornwall, he should be styled or named
John Godolphin, of Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and by that name
he accounted at the year’s end with that king for his
office in the Exchequer, and had his acquittance from
thence, as appears from the record in the Pipe Office
there.</p>

<p><!--161.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
Since which time his posterity have (ever since) made
Godolphin the hereditary name of their family. His
son, William Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall
21 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>; William Godolphin, Knight, was
Sheriff of Cornwall 29 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>; William Godolphin,
Knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall, 3 Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>;
William Godolphin, Knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall
12 Elizabeth; Francis Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards
Sir Francis, was Sheriff of Cornwall 21 Elizabeth;
Francis Godolphin, Knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall
2nd James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; Francis Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards
Knight, was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, whose
son, Sir William Godolphin, was by Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> created
the five hundred and fifty-second Baronet of
England 29th April 1661. His younger brother, Sidney
Godolphin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Member of Parliament for Helston,
one of the Commissioners of the Treasury, who had been
sent several embassies to foreign princes, was by King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> by letters patent bearing date 8th <abbr title="September">Sept.</abbr> 1684,
created Lord Godolphin and Baron of Rialton.</p>

<p>Certes, from the time that this family was seised of
Godolphin, such a race of famous, flourishing, learned,
valiant, prudent men have served their prince and
country in the several capacities of members of Parliament,
justices of the peace, deputy lieutenants, sheriffs,
colonels, captains, majors, and other officers, both military
and civil, as scarce any other family this country
hath afforded, which I do not mention (for that my
great-grandmother on the one side, the wife of Sir John
Arundell, of Tolverne, Knight, was daughter of the
aforesaid Sir Francis Godolphin, Knight, Sheriff of
Cornwall 21 Elizabeth,) but as their just character and
merit; and I challenge the envious justly to detract from
the same.</p>

<p>This Right Honourable Sidney Lord Godolphin
aforesaid, was a commissioner for the Treasury about
twenty years, which trust and office he discharged with
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
unquestionable justice, fame, and reputation, during the
reigns of King Charles the Second, King James the
Second, and till the latter end of the reign of King William
the Third, when he voluntarily resigned his office.
After that King’s death he was by Queen Anne made
sole Lord High Treasurer of England, 1701, in which
station he continued with unblamable conduct till the
year 1710, the time of his death, (having been before, by
that Queen, created Earl Godolphin,) a place of such
import, trust, grandeur, and honour, as no Cornishman
before him ever arrived to, except the Lord Benham,
(or rather their name of old Cardinham,) <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry
<abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> Two such persons perhaps for their skill in accounts,
rents, revenues of the crown, and other matters
pertaining to the exchequer, equal to, if not superior
to, any Lord Treasurer of England before them.</p>

<p>The paternal coat-armour of this noble family are,
Gules, an imperial eagle with two necks between three
fleurs-de-lis argent.</p>

<p>Pen-gar-wick in this parish, also Pen-gars-wick, id est,
the head word, or command, fenced or fortified place;
so called from the command or authority of the lord
thereof heretofore in these parts, and the strength of the
house and the tower thereof, otherwise Pen-gweras-ike,
i. e. the creek, cove, or bosom of waters, head help, as
situate upon the sea, or waters of the British Channel.
This barton and manor, in the latter end of the reign
of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, was purchased by one Mr. Milliton, a
gentleman of the county of &mdash;&mdash; where having wilfully or
accidentally committed murder, or slain a man, in order
to shun or avoid justice he privately made the purchase
aforesaid in the name of his son, and so immured himself
in a private chamber of the tower of Pengarwick,
that he was not seen of any person but his trusty friends,
so that he finished the natural course of his life without
detection of his person, or punishment for the crime
aforesaid; but, alas! notwithstanding his concealment,
<!--163.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>
and design of perpetuating his name and tribe in this
place, his son Job Milliton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> 1st Edward the Sixth,
made Governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, (in the room of
Renphry Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> executed for rebellion,) who
married Godolphin, and had issue William Milliton,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sheriff of Cornwall 7th Elizabeth, 1565, that died
without issue, and six daughters, that became his heirs,
married 1. to Erisy, afterwards to Sir Nicholas Parker;
2. to Lanyon; 3. to Trefusis, and Tregothick; 4. to
Trenwith, Arundell, and Herle; 5. to Bonython; 6. to
Abbot, from some of which heiresses, Sir Nicholas Hals,
Knight, at his first coming from Efford in Devon into
Cornwall, purchased their parts of this lordship, with
leases from the rest of the coparceners, and for some time
made it and Trewinard the places of his dwelling till he
removed to Fentongollen. This place afterwards, by
his unthrifty son and heir, John Hals, had all its timber
cut down that was growing upon it, and sold, which
tradition saith was great store; the lands also were sold
to Godolphin and some others.</p>

<p>The arms of Milliton were, out of a supposed allusion
to their name, a chevron between three millet fishes
hariant or erected; whereas Milli-ton is a mill town.</p>

<p>Mr. Sidney Godolphin must be considered as the most
eminent statesman and politician of this county, not
excepting Lord Chatham, if his birth at Boconnoc
should be deemed sufficient to make him a Cornish
man.</p>

<p>Advanced to the honour of Earl of Godolphin, decorated
with the Garter, and placed in high office as
Lord High Treasurer, he mainly conducted the great
national affairs at home, while the Duke of Marlborough
vindicated, by splendid victories in the field, the
religious and civil liberties of the world.</p>

<p>To Lord Godolphin we are also indebted for conducting
to a successful conclusion a measure most beneficial
to this whole island, the Union with Scotland; and the
whole tenour of his administration procured for him,
with the consent of all parties, the appellation of Wise.</p>

<p>In an ode inscribed to the Earl of Sunderland on his

<p>Sidney Earl of Godolphin died in 1712, and was succeeded
by his son Francis, then called Lord Rialton,
who had married Henrietta Churchill, eldest daughter
of the Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p>This lady became Duchess of Marlborough on the
decease of her father in 1722, under the provision of a
special Act of Parliament, but dying in 1733 without
issue, the Dukedom and property devolved on her nephew
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
Charles Spencer Earl of Sunderland, son of her
sister Ann Churchill.</p>

<p>The Earldom of Godolphin expired also on the death
of Francis Godolphin in 1766; but a Barony had been
conferred on him, with remainder to the heirs of his
uncle Henry Godolphin; this fell to his first cousin
Francis Lord Godolphin. On his decease in 1785 the
name and honour of Godolphin became extinct. But
Mary, daughter and eventually sole heir of Francis the
second and last Earl of Godolphin, had married Thomas
Osborne, fourth Duke of Leeds, and his great-grandson
Francis Godolphin D’Arcy Osborne, Duke of Leeds, inherits
the property as heir-at-law.</p>

<p>The Godolphins appear never to have possessed an
estate in land beyond the limits of what might fairly
belong to a private gentleman; but the produce of tin
has been very great from the period recorded by Mr.
Carew, so that the name of the place may well be derived
from that metal; subsequently, the produce of copper
has exceeded that of the tin. The whole parish of
Breage is covered by mines, and the largest and most
productive, and most expensive tin mine ever known,
is now producing a greater quantity of metal than was
yielded in former times by the whole county. Whele
Vor, now employing several steam-engines of the
largest size to exhaust the water, and numerous others
to draw up the ore, and afterwards to reduce it into the
state of a fine powder, is said to have used, about a century
ago, the first steam-engine ever seen in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Pengelly in this parish was the residence, for many
generations, of the Spernons or Sparnons. The family
became extinct on the death of a gentleman in the medical
profession at Lostwithiel, and the property was
sold about fifty years ago.</p>

<p>Present Vicar, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> R. G. Grylls, presented by
the King in 1809.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>This extensive parish includes nearly the whole of
that granitic patch known by the names of Tregonning
and Godolphin Hills; and it also comprises the greater
part of the country lying between those hills and those
of the opposite range of granite in Wendron and Crowan,
called the Forest. Its mines, quarries, and sea
cliffs afford most interesting geological sections.</p>

<p>The granite of Godolphin Hill is of the common
kind, containing in several places an intermixture of
shorl, and it is traversed by numerous thick veins of
quartz, which sometimes pass into compact shorl rock.
The granite of Tregonning Hill is of two kinds; one
fine-grained like free-stone, which is extensively quarried
on the western side of the hill, and used for ornamental
building, under the name of Breage stone; the
other, abounding in talc, and in a state of considerable
decomposition, affording, like the similar granites of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, the china clay, which is
here worked for economical purposes, but not to any
great extent.</p>

<p>The western part of the celebrated mine Whele Vor is
situated in Breage; and, as the workings approach the
granite, they exhibit a highly interesting arrangement
of rocks, the granite and slate alternating in the same
manner as they have been observed to do at Delcoath
in Cambourne. The composition of these rocks, and
the nature of their connection, are very evidently seen
<!--167.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
in the heaps of fragments piled round the shafts; but
they are better and more clearly illustrated in the cliffs
near Trewaras Head.</p>

<p>It would occupy two much space to enter into details
on this important subject. It may, however, be noticed
that both the granite and the slate gradually pass into
each other; and that they appear to differ very little in
their mineral composition. These facts seem to explain,
in a satisfactory manner, the nature of granite veins.
For, if both rocks have a similar composition, and have
been produced at the same time, the form, position,
contents, and other circumstances of these veins, are no
longer perplexing.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward is situate in the hundred of Trigg, and
hath upon the north Advent, south Blisland, east Altar
Nun, west <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tudy. There was not such parish or
church extant in Cornwall at the time of the Norman
Conquest as Brewer; probably it was taxed under Tudy.
In the inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester,
in order to the Pope’s annats, 1294, Ecclesia de
Bruerd, in Decanatu de Trig-minor-shire, was valued
at 7<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> vicar ejusdem
20<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> In Wolsey’s inquisition, 1521,
and Valor Beneficiorum, 8<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; the patronage in the Dean
and Chapter of Exeter; the incumbent Downes, the
rectory or sheaf, in &mdash;&mdash;, and the parish rated to
the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound land-tax, 1696, by the name of
Brewer, 111<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 12<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
The present name of this church is
celebrated in memory of its founder, William Brewer,
(son of William Lord Brewer, Baron of Odcombe in
Somerset,) who was consecrated Bishop of Exeter, 1224,
and was afterwards, by King Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, sent on divers
<!--168.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pageno">130</span>
embassies to foreign princes, and to conduct Isabel,
sister of the said King Henry, to be married to Frederick
the Emperor, whom he and Peter de Rupibus,
Knight, afterwards accompanied into Palestine, and
were made generals of 40,000 men against the Turks.
And after all those fatigues, as Bishop Godwin saith,
he returned home safely to his see of Exeter, and spent
the remainder of his days in building and endowing
churches, adorning and enriching his own cathedral
church, and instituting within the same a dean and
twenty-four prebendaries, allowing the latter a stipend
of 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, since augmented to
20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> (which is
no more than 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> in those days was worth). He also
set up a chantor, chancellor, and treasurer within
the same. To the chantor and subdean thereof he
appropriated the rectory of Rainton and Chudleigh in
Devon, and the rectory then, now a vicarage, of Egloshayle,
in Cornwall. To the chancellor he appropriated
(or impropriated) the vicarage of Newlan in Cornwall,
and Stoke Gabriel in Devon, on condition that he should
preach a sermon once a week. To the canons a lecture
in Divinity, or on the Decretals, within the cathedral
of Exeter, and in case the chancellor should fail in this
particular, it should be lawful for the bishop thereof for
the time being to resume the said churches so appropriated,
into his own hand, and bestow them at his pleasure;
as appears from a deed between the said bishop,
dean, and chapter, 12th May, 1662, as Hooker saith.
But this covenant is exactly kept ever since by the
chancellor or his clerk, who once a week, at six o’clock
morning prayers, preach a sermon to the canons.</p>

<p>This Bishop Brewer appropriated this church bearing
his name to the dean and chapter of this cathedral,
which he had as aforesaid erected. He lies buried in
the middle of the choir thereof, with an inscription still
legible, which, amongst others, containeth these words:
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hic jacet Willielmus Brewer, quondam hujus Ecclesiæ

four principal dignities or dignitaries of the church, I
suppose, is meant the dean, chantor, chancellor, and
treasurer thereof.</p>

<p>This parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward is also called Simon Ward;
and the popular legend has changed a pious and venerable
bishop into one Simon Ward, a domestic brewer
to King Arthur. I rather conjecture that on the division
of parishes it was called Brewer from “bruiers,”
which in the French tongue is “heath.”</p>

<p>The principal villages in this parish are Lank Major,
Lank Minor, without doubt Lank Vrauz, and Lank
Vean; perhaps lank may be lan, varying with local
pronunciation in the absence of all orthography, when
the names will signify the great and small inclosure;
also Swallock. Mr. Lysons states that the ancient
manor of Hamethy, or Hametethy, is situated in this
parish, five-sixths belonging to Mr. Mitchell of Hengar,
in the adjacent parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tudy, and the other
sixth to Mr. Kekewich.</p>

<p>But this parish is distinguished from all others in
Cornwall by the locality of Roughtor and Brown Willy;
these hills, pre-eminent from their elevation, and from
the granite crags studded over the whole expanse of
their surfaces, may be seen from an elevation crossed
by the road near Ilfracombe in the north of Devon, and

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The greater part of this parish is situated on granite,
including within its boundaries Roughtor and Brown
Willy, the highest hills in Cornwall, the latter being
1368 feet above the level of the sea. The composition
of this granite has been already noticed under the head
of Advent: it affords few varieties, which may be owing
to its offering few opportunities for examination.</p>

<p>The circumstance most attractive of attention is the
great sterility of this extensive district; some few contracted
spots are indeed brought into cultivation; some
parts afford summer pasturage for cattle, and others
turf for fuel; but by far the greater portion of the whole
lies entirely unproductive. And this character belongs to
the whole insulated patch of granite more than ten miles
in diameter; and the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward is the only
one to be found on this extensive surface of perhaps
from forty to fifty thousand acres; while nine churches
are to be found on the granite district of the Land’s End,
where this substratum, departing from its usual qualities,
gives fertility to the soil.</p>

<p>The western extremity of this parish is fertile, resting
on a peculiar kind of slate, which possesses geological
interest. It may be seen at Combe, at Penrose, and at
other places near the river Camel, and appears to be a
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
variety of mica slate, being composed of granular felspar,
interlaminated with mica. It contains beds of
dark purple felspar rock, very similar to that which
abounds in the mining district in the western part of the
county. This micaceous slate gradually passes into a
thick lamellar rock, which extensively disintegrates and
becomes argillaceous, exactly resembling the stone
quarried for building at Bodmin.</p>

that is on the north side of the river Tamar, hath upon
the north Launcells, west Marham Church, south Whitstone,
east the Tamar river. The church stands on the
Devonshire side, in the Halisworthy hundred, so that
this rule or dominion of the Bridge extendeth itself into
both counties, as to spirituals and temporals. In the

place is now the dwelling place of Mr. Samuel Gilbert.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Risdon, in his History of Devon, part <abbr title="two, page">ii. p.</abbr> 298,
gives the true etymology of this place, in those words,
“Bridge Renold, of the vulgar Bridge Rule, anciently
<!--172.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pageno">134</span>
Brige, by which name it is simply so called before the

Adobed,
and hence it took the adjunct of its owner.” The original
of the primitive name is the bridge connecting the
two parts across the Tamar.</p>

<p>The manor of Tackbere, in Domesday called Tacabere,
was one of those which the Conqueror bestowed
on his half-brother the Earl of Morton.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>This manor of Tacabre, or Takkebere, which appears
to have been very extensive, is said by Mr. Lysons to
have been bestowed by King Edward the Third on the
Abbey of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary of Graces, which appears in Tanner’s
Notitia Monastica to have been founded by that
king in the years 1349-50, in the new church-yard of
the Holy Trinity, eastward of the Tower of London.
The manor has since acquired the name of Merrifield,
probably Maryfield, from the monastery. It was for
many years the property of Gilberts, a branch from the
Gilberts of Crompton Castle, near Torbay. The only
daughter of the last Mr. Gilbert, of Tackbere, married
Mr. Cotton Amy, of Botreaux Castle, who left two
daughters; Anne, who survived her sister, but died unmarried
after a long insanity; and Grace, married to Mr.
Jonathan Phillipps, of Camelford, and of Newport, near
Launceston, who was subsequently knighted in 1786, on
the memorable occasion afforded by Margaret Nicholson.
This lady had several children: two daughters
were alive at the time of her decease in 1788, but they
both died in twelve months after their mother, and Tackbere
has ascended through the two female lines, and become
vested in the right heirs-at-law of Mr. Samuel
Gilbert, the father of Mrs. Amy.</p>

<p>The portion of this parish which is situated in Cornwall,

<p>Budock is situate in the hundred of Kerrier, and hath
upon the north Gluvias, east Falmouth, west Mawnan,
south the British channel; and by the name of Bowidoc
it was taxed in Domesday Roll, a corruption of Bud-oc,

family of the Killigrews, particularly that of Sir
John Killigrew, Knight, that married Wolverston, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Elizabeth, and some others. The barton of Arwinike,
their chief seat in former ages, being within this parish,
till Falmouth parish where it now stands was dismembered
from it by Act of Parliament 1663, near which
monument is a stone fastened to the wall of the said
church, also containing the memorial of Sir Nicholas
Parker, Knight, some time Governor of Pendennis Castle,
who married the widow of Erisey, one of the coheirs of
Militon of Pengerwick, and died 1608, who was succeeded
in that dignity by Sir Nicholas Hals of Fentongollan,
Knight.</p>

<p>The arms of Parker were, as I take it, Chequy, a fess.</p>

Killigrew.</p>

Merthin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> mother of Sir Richard Vyvyan, Baronet,
who, upon some jealousy or discontent of his wife, drank
a pint or quart of brandy, entered his chamber, took a
pistol and charged it with a brace of bullets, and then
forthwith shot himself dead, about the year 1693.</p>

<p>At Treon, Trone, (id est, Saxon, a tree,) for two or
three descents, was the dwelling of the Thomases, transnominated
to Carnsew, by living at Carnsew in Mabe;
id est, the dry rock, where they married Tripcony,
Seyntaubyn, and &mdash;&mdash; finally Thomas Carnsew,
gentleman, attorney-at law, sold those land to Trewinard,
and in testimony of the truth of the said transnomination,
this family still give for their arms the same
as Thomas, and not that of Carnsew; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field
Argent, a chevron between three talbots Sable. Trewinard

<p>On the western side of this parish, behind Arwinnick,
the seat of Sir Peter Killigrew, is a large pool, like a
little harbour, between two hills, but that it hath a bar
of sand and pebbles, which keepeth out the sea, like
that of the Loe near Helston. It is commonly called
the Swan Pool, for that Sir Peter Killigrew, to whom it
belongs, kept abundance of swans here.</p>

<p>Trewoon, or Treoon, in this parish, the downy dwelling,
or house &mdash;&mdash; in the downs, was the seat of
the Carnsews, who had their name from their habitation
at Carnsew in Mabe, where they formerly possessed a
fine estate, which, being wasted by extravagant living,
this barton was at first mortgaged, and a little after the
late Revolution, sold by Mr. John Carnsew to Joseph
Trewinnard, rector of Mawnan.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The extreme western part, adjoining Mabe, consists
of granite of a very crystalline variety, and excellent for
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pageno">138</span>
building; it is exported in great quantities from Penryn.
Nearly the whole western half of the parish is coarse;
but the eastern part is well cultivated. The soil rests
on a species of hornblend slate, which furnishes deep
soil by its decomposition.</p>

<p>On the sea shore at Swanpool a most interesting phenomenon
occurs in a bed of felspar porphyry, (elvan
course,) which runs north-east and south-west for several
hundred feet: near low water it exhibits that appearance
called by the miners a heave. The course
terminates abruptly, and begins again about twenty
feet further to the south, from whence it goes on as before
the heave.</p>

<p>This porphyry is decomposed at the surface and to
some depth, into a fine white clay, from which bricks of
a good quality are made on the spot.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">BURIAN.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Burian is situated at the western extremity of the
county, having two adjoining parishes, Senner and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan annexed; the former of which includes the
Lands’ End. In Domesday tax this district was rated
by the name of Beriand, for Berian or Bury-an; synonymous
words, signifying a cemetery or burying place
for human creatures; that is to say, that place which is
now called the churchyard, which was an inclosure, as
in most other places, converted to that use before and
since the church was erected therein. This instance of
a Domesday Roll, wherein this district is named Beri-an,
overthrows the story of Camden’s conjecture, that the
name thereof was derived from one <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Buryana, an
<!--177.png--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
Irishwoman that was the tutelar guardian of this church,
whereas the appellation of Saint, as I have elsewhere
observed, at that time was not given to but one church
in Cornwall. Besides, this Irish saint is not to be found
in the Roman legend, or calendar, nor in Capgrave’s
catalogue of English and Irish Saints.</p>

<p>This church was founded and endowed by King
Athelstan, about the year 930, after such time as he had
conquered the Scilly Islands, as also the county of Devon;
and made Cornwall tributary to his sceptre. To
which church he gave lands and tithes of a considerable
value for ever, himself becoming the first patron thereof,
as his successors the Kings of England have been ever
since: for which reason it is still called the royal rectory,
or regal rectory, and the royal or regal peculiar.
Signifying thereby that this is the church or chapel pertaining
to the king, or immediately under the jurisdiction
of him as the supreme ordinary, from when there is
no appeal; whereas other peculiars, though exempt
from the visitation or jurisdiction of the diocesan bishop
within whose see they stand, yet are always subject to
the provincial archbishops of Canterbury and York, or
other persons.</p>

<p>This church or college consisted of canons augustines,
or regular priests, and three prebendaries, who
enjoyed the revenues thereof in common, but might not
marry; and the lord chancellors of England of old visited
this peculiar, which extended only over the parishes
of Burian, Sennen, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Levan, for the king.</p>

<p>One of the Popes of Rome, about the time of Edward
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> obtruded upon this church, the canons and prebends
thereof, a dean to be an inspector and overseer
over them: whom he nominated to be the bishop of
Exon for the time being, who for some time visited this
church as its governor, as the lord chancellor did before;
which encroachment of the Pope being observed by
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, as appears from the register of the writs,
<!--178.png--><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>
folio 40 and 41; 8 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> rot. 97. This usurpation
of the Pope was taken away.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals here enters into long dissertations respecting
secular canons, regular canons, the state generally
of the church and of the clergy, benefices held in commendam,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> which, not having any particular relation
to the parochial history of Cornwall, are omitted.]</p>

<p>Boscawen-ros in this parish, compounded of Boscawen-ros,
is a name given and taken from the natural
circumstances of the place, and signifies in Cornish-British
“a valley, notable for skeawe or scawen” trees.
And indeed this place, being naked and exposed to the
sea on the cliffs of the British Channel, anciently, as it
seems, produced no other trees than scawen, (i. e. elder,)
proper to that part of the country; neither, I think, is
there any other trees at present that grow there. From
this place was transnominated an Irish gentleman that
settled here either by marriage or purchase, in the latter
end of the reign of Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, who discontinued his
paternal name, and styled himself John de Boscawen,
which latter name hath been the hereditary name of his
posterity ever since; who from hence transplanted their
dwellings to Tregameer in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Major; and Trevallock
in Creed or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s; and from thence, by
marriage with the daughter and heir of Tregothnan by
Lawrence Boscawen, gentleman, attorney-at-law, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, who died 1567, and lieth buried in the
north aile of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell Church, as is testified
by a brass inscription on his gravestone, there
lately extant, upon which, on a lead escutcheon, was
engraved his paternal coat armour, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field Vert, a
bull passant Argent, armed Or; on a chief Ermine, a
rose Gules; crest a boar Argent:&mdash;out of a supposed
allusion to their present name, as if it had signified a
white bull and a rose. In the reign of James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> his posterity
discontinued this bearing, and gave only for their
arms, Ermine, a rose; which, I take it, also is the hereditary
<!--179.png--><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pageno">141</span>
coat armour of Beverley. See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell.
Since the writing hereof this place is become
the hereditary honorary title of Hugh Lord Boscawen,
Baron of Boscawen-rose, and Viscount of Falmouth.</p>

<p>Upon Boscawen downs, some of which was lately
the lands of Mr. Christopher Davis, stands a monument
called Dance Meyns, that is to say the dance
stones; which are nineteen pyramidal stones, about six
foot high above ground, set in a round circle, distant
from each other about twelve feet, having in the centre
one pitched far bigger than the rest; a little to the north
of those are two admirable great stones in perpendicular
manner, much bigger than the rest, those are vulgarly
called the Pipers. But since it is not probable that
those stones were either dancers or pipers, I take the
common appellation dance meyns, only by the dialect
to be a corruption of dans meyns, id est, men’s stones;
that is to say stones set up in memory of once so many
famous men that lived in those parts, or lie interred there,
before the sixth century.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_22" id="fnanchor_22"></a><a href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span>
Mr. Davis aforesaid informed
me, that, contiguous with those dans meynes, he caused
not long since divers barrows of earth to be carried abroad
in order to manure his lands, in several of which burrows
he found two or three urns or earthern pots, sound
and firm, having in them pieces of bones, and ashes.</p>

<p><!--180.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pageno">142</span>
About twenty years past, the sexton of this parish
sinking a grave four feet deep in the ground, he met
with a large flat marble or other stone, which he lifted
up out of the earth, on which was cut or engraved a
long plain cross, surmounted on four grieces or steps;
on the border of this stone, round the said cross, was an
inscription in Norman French, which soundeth thus in
English:&mdash;“Clarice, the wife of Geffery de Bolleit, lies
here; whosoever shall pray for her soul shall have ten
days’ pardon. Amen.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_23" id="fnanchor_23"></a><a href="#footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></span>
There is a place still extant in
this parish called Bolait, or Bolaith, i. e. a place of slaying
or killing cows, kine, or cattle; otherwise it may be
interpreted cow’s milk, or a place notable for the same.</p>

<p>Trove, in this parish, is, in Cornish and Armorick, a
dent, pit, a cavern, or valley: a name doubtless taken
from the natural and artificial circumstances of the
place, situate between two hills, on a cavern; also Trewoofe,
that is to say the town or dwelling of ob-yarn,
such as the sail-spinsters make, in order to be woof, or
woven cross the warp in pieces of cloth, stuff, or serges,
from whence was denominated a family of gentlemen
named Trewoofe; who, out of a mistaken etymology of
their name, (as many others in Cornwall,) gave for their
arms, in a field &mdash;&mdash; three wolves’ heads; whereas,
try-bleith, try-bleit, is three wolves in Cornish; the
heiress of which family was married to Leveale, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> of the old Norman race, whose posterity
flourished here in good fame for several descents, till,
for want of issue male, Lewis Leveale’s daughter and
heir, by Cooke of Tregussa, carried this place, together
with herself in marriage, to Mr. Uspar or Vospar, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> who had issue Arthur Vosper, his son and
heir, who married Eyans, of Eyanston in Oxfordshire,
who had issue by her two daughters, married to Mr.
<!--181.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
Marke of Woodhill and Mr. Dennis of Leskeard. This
last gentleman, Mr. Vospur, bathing himself in the river
Isis in Oxfordshire, with other young men, was there
unfortunately drowned, about the year 1679. The
name Vosper or Vospur, in British-Cornish, signifies a
pure or immaculate maid or virgin. The arms of Leveale
were three calves or veals.</p>

<p>In the middle of this barton of Trove, on the top of a
hill, is still extant the downfalls of a castle or treble
intrenchment called &mdash;&mdash;, in the midst of which
is a hole leading to a vault under ground. How far it
extends no man now living can tell, by reason of the
damps or thick vapours that are in it; for as soon as
you go an arrow flight in it or less, your candles will go
out, or extinguish of themselves, for want of air. For
what end or use this vault was made is uncertain,
though it is probable it was an arsenal or store-house
for laying up arms, ammunition, corn, and provision,
for the soldiers of the castle wherein it stands, in the
wars between Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and his Parliament. Divers of
the royal party, pursued in the West by the Parliament
troops under Sir Thomas Fairfax, were privately conveyed
into this vault as far as they could proceed with
safety, where Mr. Leveale fed and secured them till they
found opportunity to make their escapes to the king’s
friends and party. See <a href="#Evall"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Evall.</a></p>

<p>Pentre, otherwise Pendrea, in this parish, id est,

<p>This parish is of large extent, and the land generally
good, and lying very warm on the South Sea, which,
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
with the desire of living quiet, has induced several gentlemen
to settle themselves in this remote corner of the

out of curiosity come to visit the Land’s End.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Paynter was brother to Doctor William

both younger brothers to Mr. Paynter of Trelisick’s
father, who by his skill in husbandry, in which
he has scarce his fellow, not his superior in the county,
and some helps of the law, has purchased to himself a
very fair younger brother’s inheritance. Though this
place lies near the sea, and very much exposed, yet has
this gentleman, by the means of furze ricks and other
ingenious contrivances, raised several fair walks of trees
about it, and made it a pleasant and profitable seat,
which I mention here, that those who live under the
same inconveniences may imitate his industry. At
Leigha liveth Mr. Oliver Ustick, married to Julia the
eldest of two daughters of &mdash;&mdash; Roscrow of Penryn, of

<p>Boscawanrose, in this parish, gave name and habitation
to the famous and honourable family of Boscawan, who,
led away, as many other Cornish gentlemen have been,
by the similarity of sound between words in the Kernawish
tongue and others in French or in Latin, have mistaken
rose a valley, for the flower a rose; and more anciently
they are said to have borne in their arms, besides
a rose, an ox, having mistaken the word bos, which signifies
a house or dwelling, for the name of that animal.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It seems very improbable that King Athelstan, after
founding and splendidly endowing a church to commemorate
<!--184.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>
or to sanctify his conquest of Cornwall, should
bestow on it a name so very indiscriminate as The burial-ground;
more especially at a time when missionaries
from Ireland had recently converted the inhabitants to
Christianity, and had left to posterity a reputation for
piety so elevated as to invest them at once with the appellation
of saints, and to procure for them, in after
times, the dedication of almost all the churches throughout
the County.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian is mentioned by Leland, Camden, Tanner,
and various other antiquaries, as a holy woman from
Ireland, to whom King Athelstan dedicated this church,
and in Doctor Alban Butler’s Lives of the Saints, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
her festival is given on the 4th of June.</p>

<p>The establishment consisted of a dean and three prebendaries,
who are said by Mr. Lysons to have held from
the King by the service of saying a hundred masses and
a hundred psalters for the souls of the King and of his
ancestors. It is not stated how frequently those recitations
were to take place.</p>

<p>Bishop Tanner, in the Notitia Monastica, states that
this deanery was seised into the king’s hands in the time
of Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> under the pretence that John de Mount,
the third dean, was a Frenchman. In 18 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
this deanery was given to his college (King’s) in Cambridge;
and afterwards, by Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> probably in the
true spirit of party, to the collegiate church of Windsor.
It was, however, soon separated from Windsor, and
continues, according to the foundation of Athelstan,
exempt from all inferior jurisdiction, and consequently
since Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>’s assumption of all temporal power
exercised by the Pope, there is not any appeal from
the local authorities but to the king himself; a constitution
most inexpedient, and likely to produce the most
serious inconvenience, if matters of much importance
ever came for investigation and decision before a court
wholly unfitted, from its very nature, from entertaining
<!--185.png--><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pageno">147</span>
them; and yet empowered to declare a judgment
final to all intents and purposes, unless it is immediately
revised by the highest and most expensive ecclesiastical
tribunal.</p>

<p>This exemption from all episcopal authority has, in
times not very remote, admitted of such abuses in the
administration of divine service, and of the spiritual
care of the three parishes, as would not otherwise have
been endured. It would be worse, however, than useless
to expatiate on a system which is fortunately
passed by.</p>

<p>I believe that no dean has resided since the final
dissolution of the college; the Royner’s hand having
been there so forcibly applied as to wrest off the whole
glebe, not leaving even an habitation, nor the smallest
portion of land on which a house could be built.
The nominal deanery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian, like that of Battle
and two or three more, is not esteemed a dignity in
the church: yet with cure of souls, and for no better
reason than its not being mentioned <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo nomine</i> in the
canons and acts of Parliament, this living is allowed
to be tenable with all other preferments, and at all distances.</p>

<p>Pendrea, the birth place and property of Mr. William
Noye the attorney-general, was sold by his eldest son,
Edward Noye, to Mr. Davies of Burnuhall, and by
his grandson to Mr. Tonkin, whose great grandson, the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Uriah Tonkin, possesses it at this time. At Burnuhall
there still remains a curious performance of
shell-work, said to have been made by Mr. Davies’
daughters, strongly expressive of the political feelings
then almost universal throughout Cornwall. King
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> is represented flying from his enemies, and
one of them, in full pursuit, has a legend, “This is the
heir! come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may
be our own!” whilst an angel exclaims in the same
manner from a cloud “Is it not written, Thou shalt
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pageno">148</span>
do no murder?” The material of this work is found in
great variety and beauty round the coast, and particularly
at Porth Kernow, near the Logging Rock.</p>

<p>The last Mr. Davies of Burnuhall married &mdash;&mdash; Kegwin of Newlyn; he wasted the remains of a property
which had been gradually diminishing in the hands of
his father and of his grandfather; so that about the
year 1750, Burnuhall and some other farms were sold
to Admiral Boscawen.</p>

<p>Boskenna is the property and residence of Mr. Francis
Paynter, a very respectable gentleman and magistrate, the
great-grandson, I believe, of the individual distinguished
by Mr. Hals for his skill in husbandry. There is a
tradition of his having purchased the place of one whose
family had long possessed it, but who had ultimately
become the huntsman of a pack of hounds kept originally
as his own.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Paynter, uncle of the gentleman now
possessed of Boskenna, was greatly distinguished for
his wit and humour. He was either the sole or joint
author of a poem made in imitation of Prior’s Alma,
and in ridicule of the then dean of Burian, called “The
Consultation.” Mr. Paynter practised his profession
of the law near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb. He married Miss Pender
of Penzance, and left several sons. The exercise of wit
is not always, perhaps not frequently, associated with
pecuniary gain. The Editor has heard Mr. Paynter
declare that “The Consultation” prevented his obtaining
a valuable stewardship from the family of which
the dean was a member.</p>

<p>The Vyvyans of Trelovornow are said to have originated
from Treviddror in this parish. And Lord Chief
Justice Tresilian was from Burian, in whose descendants
Pendor and Ristchurch, after the lapse of nearly
five centuries, some of his property still remains.</p>

<p>From about fifty to seventy years ago Boskenna attracted
much attention, and gave occasion to various
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
conjectures over the whole neighbourhood, in consequence
of a gentleman and lady residing there under the
assumed name of Browne, and withdrawing themselves
entirely from public observation. They were conjectured
to be members of some distinguished family on
the continent implicated in political disputes; or at the
least, some very eminent persons of our own country,
till at last the mystery was explained by a disclosure of
their real name and condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Berty Birge, having been involved in the pecuniary
affairs of an individual who subsequently became
insane, found himself obliged to retire, although
it is understood that nothing discreditable to his character
occurred in the transactions. On that individual’s
decease Mr. Birge resumed his real name, and
removed to Penzance, where he passed the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p>The church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian is among those most distinguished
for size and beauty in the west of Cornwall.
It is situated on high ground, with a lofty tower, conspicuous
therefore from a very great distance. It possessed,
till within these few years, a curious rood-loft.</p>

<p>A station of the great trigonometrical survey was
placed in 1796 very near Burian church, and in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1800, the latitude of the
tower is stated to be 50<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 4<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 32.8<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>, and the longitude is
5<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> 36<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 10.5<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr>, or in time 22<abbr title="minutes">′</abbr> 24.7<abbr title="seconds">″</abbr> west of Greenwich.</p>

<p>The whole of this parish, with the exception of a
small patch of slate at Rosemodris, rests on granite.
Judging from what occurs in the eastern part of Cornwall,
one might be led to expect that the land of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Burian must be sterile. In some elevated spots it undoubtedly
is so, but in general the parish is well cultivated
and highly productive.</p>

<p>This difference in the granitic soils of east and of
west Cornwall, may be, in part, explained by the gradual
diminution of height towards the west, accompanied by
a corresponding improvement of the climate; but in
this part of the county more of the debris, especially of
diluvial clay, is retained on the surface, that of the
more elevated eastern ridges having been in great
measure swept away.</p>

<p>This circumstance must not, however, be omitted.
The granite of Burian exhibits more varieties than have
been yet found in the eastern district. The slate in
the cliffs at Rosemodris is a felspar rock, and its contact
with the granite is distinctly seen; where it may be
observed at the eastern extremity traversed by numerous
granite veins; and the granite near this junction
abounds in shorl.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">NOTE BY THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Doctor Paris has remarked on the granite of this
district, that it contains full twenty-five per cent. of
felspar, which he says at once explains the rapidity of
this stone’s decomposition, and the fertility which is
so very unusual in granitic countries; and that this
granite in a state of decomposition, when it is provincially
called growan, has actually been applied to some
lands as a manure, and with the best effect.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of attending Doctor Withering
(author of the Arrangement of British Plants, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) to
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
the Land’s End in 1793, when he expressed much surprise
at the fertility of a granitic soil, and explained it
as Doctor Paris has since done, by observing that in all
the granite he had previously seen siliceous matter
abounded, and that the very word was synonymous with
sterile, but that here felspar and fertility appeared
together.</p>

<p>Felspar is said to contain nearly a third part of its
weight of alumine, about an eighth part of lime, and a
twentieth of soda.</p>

<p>The north-eastern part of this parish extends to the
east of Kitt Hill, the most elevated point of Hingston
Downs, which is composed of granite. The slate adjoining
thereto resembles that which occurs in similar
situations in the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Blazey;
and this district has been the scene of considerable
mining speculations. In former ages it abounded in
stream tin to such an amount that the Cornishmen of
those days expressed their opinion of its value by the
distich</p>

<p>As the town of Callington is approached, the slate
becomes of a darker blue, and passes into hornblend
rock, which prevails in the other parts of the parish,
and in several places so much abounds in quartz as to
form barren downs. This rock, however, has not any
marked character, and it is not often exposed to view;
near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive it appears to graduate into the calcareous

<p>The rectory of Calstock church seems to be extant

<p>It appears from the ancient survey of the Duchy of

thence, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122, that the tenants of this manor had
granted them, by the Earls or Dukes thereof, its lords,
the liberty of free fishing on the Tamar river, in his

rewarded for his services by that prince.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Calstock, or Calstoke, has of late become a mining
parish on an extensive scale. The manor having been
sold by the Duchy for the redemption of Land Tax, has
ultimately become the property of Mr. John Williams,
one of the most skilful and successful miners in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Cotehele is preserved by Lord Mount Edgecombe as a
faithful representative of what were the residences of
country gentlemen or barons in the ancient acceptation
of that word.</p>

<p>“It came,” says Lysons, “into the possession of the
Edgecombe family, by the marriage of Hilaria, daughter
and heir of William de Cotehele, with William
de Edgecombe, in the reign of Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> After this
marriage, Cotehele became for a while the chief residence
of the Edgecombe family.” Carew, speaking of
this place, says, “the buildings are ancient, large, strong,
and fayre, and appurtenanced with the necessaries of
wood, water, fishing, park, and mills, with the devotion
of (in times past) a rich-furnished chapel, and with the
charity of almshouses, for certain poor people, whom
the owners used to relieve.”</p>

<p>The beauty of its situation, the river and ancient
ponds, united with the antiquities of the place, render
Cotehele one of the most curious and worthy of attention
in the West of England; and the following description,
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
taken in 1830 by an architectural correspondent of
the Gentleman’s Magazine, is therefore extracted from
that miscellany for 1833.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“There is a singularity about this Mansion, which
requires to be accounted for. It cannot claim an origin
in very remote antiquity, the earliest parts being not
older than the reign of Henry the Seventh; yet the narrowness
of the windows and other openings, and the
tower above the gateway, would lead to the idea that
it was built in an early insecure period. This, I think,
may be accounted for from the fact that the builder, Sir
Richard Edgecombe, had encountered personal danger in
the wars of the Roses, and probably erected his mansion
in the early part of the reign of Henry the Seventh, so
soon after the conclusion of the conflict, that he might
be impressed with the fear that the reign of the newly
enthroned monarch might not be more peaceable than
that of his predecessors, and he adopted under these impressions
the style which the mansion now displays.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The house is quadrangular, with a court-yard in the
centre; and, like the generality of the mansions of antiquity,
has the appendage of a hall and chapel. It is
built of moor-stone in irregular courses, though some of
the blocks are exceedingly large. The west front is not
imposing, from the want of height, which detracts from
its general appearance. The entrance is not in the
centre, and is only wide enough for foot passengers; it
consists of an obtuse pointed arch, slightly moulded
with foliage on the spandrils, which is inclosed within
another of larger dimensions with a weather cornice, and
on the space between the two is a blank shield accompanied
by two bold leaves. The windows are situated
high in the wall; they are of small dimensions, being in
fact little more than enlarged loopholes. The chimneys
are square, having caps formed with coping stones.
Above the entrance is a tower of a cubical form, with
an embattled parapet. On entering the court through
<!--194.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
the gateway, the Hall is seen in the front, and near it,
on the west side of the quadrangle, the lantern window
of the Chapel.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The interior of the Hall is very interesting. The
roof is timber, and arched; and on the walls hang various
pieces of armour and weapons of considerable antiquity,
with a complete suit of armour, which is probably
not older than the Civil wars. In the end walls
are apertures in the shape of a quatrefoil, which admit
a view of the hall from adjacent apartments, and would
allow the motions of persons assembled in it to be watched.
There are some specimens of ancient furniture in the
hall; in particular a chair having the date 1627. In
the windows are several armorial shields in stained glass.</p>

 />
 <p class="caption">CHAPEL AT COTEHELE.</p>
</div>

<p class="blockquote">“The Chapel projects from the western side of the
mansion. It is small and neat, and has a small bell-tower.
The square window in the west end is unglazed;
the aperture being secured by wide bars; but allowing
<!--195.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
any person standing on the outside to see the altar. At
the distance of a few feet from the door lies an ancient
font, 19 inches square by 14 inches deep; it is formed
of a block of moorstone, and panelled at the sides. The
interior of this chapel is approached from the mansion
by the hall, to which it communicates through a small
room. The roof is timber, ribbed and panelled; and
coved in the form of an obtuse arch. In the south window
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anne and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Katherine are represented in
painted glass. The altar is oak, with upright panels,
having quatrefoil heads. An ancient altar cloth is preserved
in the house; it is formed of red velvet powdered
with fleur-de-lis, and the part which was shown when it
was laid on the altar, had a crucifix in the centre, accompanied
by the twelve apostles in rich embroidery,
and the arms of Edgecombe.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The limit of a single visit would not allow me to
particularize the various articles of furniture contained
in the mansion. In the drawing-room the screen to the
doorway appears to be of the date of the building; on
the door itself are roses in lozenges. The bedroom,
called King Charles’s, has a fine ancient state bed, with
a profusion of carved work about it; and a steel mirror.
The dog-inns, some of which are probably as old as the
mansion, remain in the fire-places. Two chairs commemorate
a visit from King George the Third and Queen
Charlotte in 1789.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the grounds is another chapel, which derives its
interest from the circumstance of its having been erected
by Sir Richard Edgecombe in commemoration of his
escape from his pursuers by concealment near the spot.
It is much injured by modern alterations made in 1769,
and externally retains little of its original features. In
the interior are several ancient paintings, which probably
formed the decorations of an ancient altar-piece;
when entire, it represented the Annunciation. In the
east window are <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, and a female saint with a
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pageno">158</span>
sword, in painted glass, and several coats of arms. There
is also an ancient painting of the monument of the
founder of the chapel, who was buried in the conventual
church of Morlaix in Bretagne, in September 1489;
and a carving in wood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas a Becket.”</p>

<p>It is a curious circumstance in the history of Cornwall,
that several of the principal gentlemen from this
remote county, took active parts on either side between
King Richard the Third and his antagonist Henry the
Seventh: many were present at the battle of Bosworth.
Mr. Carew relates (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 269, Lord Dunstanville’s edition)
the almost miraculous escape of Sir Richard Edgecombe
of Cotehele, when he was pursued (as I apprehend)
by <a name="err16" id="err16"></a>Bodrigar, who, in his turn, found himself
obliged to fly after the defeat of King Richard; and his
property was divided between Edgecumbe and Trevanion,
with whom a large part of it still remains.</p>

<p>The river from Cotehele to New Bridge exhibits a magnificence
of scenery very rarely to be found: the cliffs
on the east and north-eastern bank affording here the
steep and bold scarpment, as in all other similar situations
throughout the country.</p>

<p>Harewood, in this parish, although in the different
style of a modern seat, almost rivals Cotehele: this spacious
and elegant house was built almost forty years
ago by Mr. Foot; but the place was sold after his decease,
and it is now the property and residence of Mr. William
Salusbury Trelawney, heir of that ancient and distinguished
family. Mr. Trelawney married Miss Carpenter,
of Mount Toby, near Tavistock, and now (1833)
represents the eastern division of Cornwall in Parliament.</p>

<p>Sandhill is another handsome seat in this parish, occupied
by Mr. Williams, who, since his purchase of
the manor, has improved the waste lands, planted such
elevated or steep portions as were unfit for agriculture,
and in every way contributed to the prosperity of the
place and of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>This parish contains 5035 statute acres.<!--198.png--><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span></p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>The Geological structure of this parish is precisely
similar to that of Callington; but, as it is better developed,
it will admit of a little more detail.</p>

<p>The northern part consists of the granite of Hingston
Down, which is crystalline, and it is extensively quarried
for economical purposes. The quarries near the summit
of Kitt Hill afford excellent illustrations of the internal
structure of the granitic mass. On this Down, beds of
fine-grained granite project here and there above the
surface, resembling that which occurs as Elvan courses
in the adjacent slate. The latter rock consists of a basis
of granular felspar, spotted and spangled with a shining
mineral like mica. This slate, as well as the granite,
have been long explored for tin and copper. Shorl and
mica generally abound in the lodes; and the former mineral
is often so intimately combined with the quartz, as
to form a dark-coloured compact shorl rock. Southward
the slate becomes more blue, and is fissile into extended
slabs. Near the village of Calstock it is soft and
lamellar, having evidently graduated into the calcareous
series. At Cotehele, near the landing place, a beautiful
oved-coloured calcareous schist is quarried, which is said
to prove a good material for lining kilns and ovens: it
has a shining talcose appearance, resembling that of
Trenalt, near Pallephant, in Alternon.</p>

Nearly opposite to the Rectory, built by Bishop Blackbourn,
and pleasantly situated on the river, may be seen
the debouch of a canal from Tavistock, with an inclined
plane, descending into the Tamar. This canal, in one
part of its line, passes through a hill at the depth of
seventy fathoms.</p>

who married Godolphin, the widow of Hoblyn of Nanswidon.
<!--199.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pageno">161</span>
His father, Thomas Pendarves, clerk, rector of

Hoblyn of Nanswiddon; his grandfather, Arundell of
Menadarva; his great-grandfather Humphrys; and
giveth for his arms, in a field Sable, a falcon Argent
displayed, between three mullets Or.</p>

<p>Menadarva, in this parish, is the dwelling of William
Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> descended from the Arundells of Trerice,
to whose ancestor, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> it was given by the
last will and testament of John Arundell, of Trerice,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (commonly called John of Tilbury, for that with
Queen Elizabeth, at that place, he was an officer under
her in the standing army posted in that place in expectation
of and to oppose the Spanish Armada 1588), in
those words amongst other&mdash;“Item, I give to my naturall
son, John Arundell, my mannor and barton of Menadarva
in Camburne, and to his heirs lawfully begotten
for ever.”</p>

<p>The last gentleman of this family dying without issue
male, his sisters for a time, married to Tresahar and
others, became possessed of this lordship; but it happened
that a brother of theirs also, who was a merchant
factor in Spain, who married an innkeeper’s widow there,
in Malaga or Seville, of English extraction, was said to
be dead without issue, but it seems before his death had
issue by her an infant son, which was bred up in Spain
till he came of age, without knowledge of his relations
aforesaid; who, being brought into England with his
mother, <abbr title="tempore William Three">temp. Will. III.</abbr> delivered ejectments upon the
barton and manor of Menadarva, and the occupants
thereof, as heir-at-law to Arundell, and brought down a
trial upon the same at Lanceston, in this county; where
upon the issue it appeared, upon the oaths of Mr. Delliff
and other Spanish merchants of London, that the
said heir was the legitimate son of Mr. Arundell aforesaid
in Spain, and born under coverture or marriage; he
obtained a verdict and judgment thereon for the same,
<!--200.png--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pageno">162</span>
and is now in possession thereof. He married Tremanheer
of Penzance, and hath issue. The arms of this family
are the same as those of the Arundells of Trerice,

<p>Roswarne, in this parish, gave to its owner the name

<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> to Ezekiel Grosse, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law,
who made it his dwelling, and in this place got a great
estate by the inferior practice of the law; but much
more,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_25" id="fnanchor_25"></a><a href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></span>
as tradition saith, by means of a spirit or apparition
that haunted him in this place till he spake to it
(for it is notable that sort of things called apparitions,
are such proud gentry that they never speak first),
whereupon it discovered to him where much treasure lay
hid in this mansion, which, according to the (honest)
ghost’s direction he found, to his great enriching; after
which this phantasm or spectrum become so troublesome
and direful to him day and night, that it forced him
to forsake this place (as rich, it seems, as this devil could
make him) and to quit his claim thereto by giving or
selling it to his clerk John Call; whose son, John Call,
<abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> sold it again to Robert Hooker, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law,
now in possession thereof. The arms of Call were, in
a field three trumpets, in allusion to the name in English;
but in Cornish British, call, cal, signifies any hard,
flinty, or obdurate matter or thing, and hirgorne is a
trumpet.</p>

<p>Crane, adjoining Roswarne, gave name to its possessor
Cit-crane, who gave bustards or cranes for his arms;
for as Crana, Krana, is as grus in Latin, so it is a crane
in English; garan and cryhyr is in the Welsh. One of

Brayes, gentlemen heretofore of great antiquity, good
note, and considerable revenues in those parts; though
in the time of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> their estate was much impaired,
so that the last gentleman of this family dying much indebted,
and no heir appearing, occasioned a memorable
lawsuit between Sir Francis Basset, knight, lord of the
manor of Tyhiddy, of which those lands of Treswithan
were held, and the creditors of Mr. Braye, then in possession
of the premises: when in fine, upon the issue at
law at Lanceston, the jury gave it in escheat, for want
of issue, to Sir Francis Basset, in right of his manor
aforesaid, the verdict passing against the creditors;
whereby the posterity of Sir Francis are possessed of it
to this day.</p>

<p>Camborne has risen more rapidly into wealth and importance
than any other parish in Cornwall. The
church tower is so large and well-built, and it possesses
with a market so many appendages of a regular town,
that the prefix church may well be omitted.</p>

<p>Pendarves was given by Mrs. Percevall, surviving sister
of Sir William Pendarves, to Mr. John Stackhouse,
second son of Doctor William Stackhouse, Rector of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anne, who married Miss Williams, heiress of that
branch of the Williamses of Probus, which had settled
at Trehane. Mr. John Stackhouse married Miss Acton,
with whom he acquired a very large property in Shropshire:
his son, Mr. Edward William Wynne Pendarves
is now the proprietor. Pendarves has become a very
handsome seat in consequence of the successive improvements
made by the late Mr. Stackhouse and himself.
He has adopted the name of Pendarves in the
place of Stackhouse, and added Wynne in gratitude
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pageno">164</span>
of a large addition made to his fortunes by the late Reverend
Luttrell Wynne, <abbr title="Doctor of Laws">LL.D.</abbr></p>

<p>Mr. Pendarves has followed the examples of his two
immediate predecessors, by marrying a considerable
heiress, Miss Triste, from Devonshire. He has been twice
elected member for the county, and now (1833) represents
the western division of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Menadarva was purchased by the late Mr. Basset, and

<p>Rosewarne was the residence of Mr. William Harris,
who greatly increased his fortune by skill and success in
mining. He served the office of sheriff in 1773. His
only daughter and heiress is married to Mr. Winchcombe
Hartley, a gentleman of Berkshire.</p>

<p>Crane, with several adjoining farms, became the property
of Mr. John Oliver Willyams, of Carnanton, in
right of his mother, and the whole, on his demise, was
purchased by Lord Dunstanville.</p>

<p>I cannot close my short additions to Camborne without
noticing Mr. Richard Trevithick. No one, with
the exception of Mr. Watt, has probably contributed in
so great a degree to the improvement of steam-engines,
the most important and the most philosophical of all
mechanical inventions. His enterprise has also equalled
the abstract powers of his mind, and for several years
he laboured in South America to give the mines of that
great continent the advantage of European machinery;
but civil wars, and the instability of Governments, defeated
his best endeavours, so as to render them, up to
the present time, unavailing either to those mines or to
himself.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.<!--203.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span></p>

<p>The eastern and south-western sides of this parish are
situate on granite, the greater part consisting of high
and barren hills, including Carnbrea and Carnkie. This
rock is large-grained, and not very prone to disintegrate;
it is occasionally traversed by beds of felspar porphyry.</p>

<p>On the boundaries of this granite, and in the adjacent
slate, are numerous tin and copper-mines, the most interesting
of which are Delcoath and Cock’s Kitchen;
the latter extends into the parish of Illogan, but is a
continuation of the Camborne lodes. Delcoath has
been for many years the deepest mine in Cornwall. It
stands at the surface, about fifty fathoms (300 feet) above
the level of the sea, and the deepest shaft is about a
hundred and eighty fathoms (1080 feet) below the sea
level, making on the whole a depth from the surface of
nearly 1400 feet.</p>

<p>These mines exhibit the curious geological phenomena
of alternating granite and slate; that is, in sinking
a perpendicular shaft, the miner passes repeatedly out of
one of these rocks into the other. Various theoretical
opinions have been entertained on this subject: some
geologists supposing that the layers are no more than
irregular protuberances from the main mass of the rock;
whilst others consider them as large veins dipping towards
and communicating with the granite at a great
depth. But it is ascertained that these granite layers
are sometimes detached or insulated masses, whilst at
other times they form large veins or courses, which
have regular bearings to a considerable distance, and
are then called elvans; to form, however, a correct
idea of the features of these phenomena, we must become
acquainted, not with the appearance only, but with
the nature and composition of these two rocks.</p>

<p>Granite and slate are usually considered, from their
exterior character, as very dissimilar, whereas in this
situation their real composition is nearly alike.</p>

<p><!--204.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>
The granite immediately in contact with the slate,
consists of compact felspar, containing particles or crystals
of felspar, quartz, and mica, in variable proportions,
but the whole generally increasing towards the centre of
the mass. So that the granite is changed into a felspar
rock or porphyry rock, scarcely ever resembling a well
characterised granite; while the slate in contact has
received the various names of greywacke, greenstone,
clayslate, and killas; but it appears to be a rock <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui
generis</i>, consisting almost entirely of compact felspar,
coloured purple or blue by its intimate union with a
dark-coloured micaceous mineral, sometimes seen distinct
on the surface of the slate, and from which it appears
to derive its lamellar structure. The bases of
these two rocks are therefore the same, and at the point
of contact it is often difficult to draw a line between
them; for the slate passes into white compact felspar by
the gradual disappearance of its colouring mineral; and
this granite rock, by the more and more additions of
felspar, quartz, and mica, reassumes its usual character.</p>

<p>On this view of the subject, it is easy to comprehend
why the granite and the slate alternate and mutually
pass into each other; and an explanation may also be
given of the complicated phenomena of granite veins in
slate, when it is assumed that both rocks are not only of
contemporaneous origin, but likewise similar in their
mineral composition.</p>

<p>Between this mining district and a line drawn east and
west across the parish, a little north of the church town,
the land is in most places very good; but north of this
line, at the extremity of the parish, where it abuts on
the sea, the ground is almost entirely uncultivated, affording
nothing more than a slight pasturage for sheep.
At Godrevy Point there is laid open an interesting section
of diluvial deposits: one of the beds, composed of
shelly sand and pebbles, is consolidated with sandstone
and conglomerate.</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">CARDINHAM.</h3>

<p class="p2 center small">HALS.</p>

<p>Cardinham is situate in the hundred of West, and
hath upon the north Blisland, Temple, and part of
Altarnun; south, Bradock and Warleggan; west,
Bodmin. For the name, it is compounded of those particles,
car-din-ham, id est, the rock-man’s-home or
habitation; also car-dyn-an, i. e. the rock man, or a
man that dwells upon, or has his residence amongst
rocks, or in a rocky country, with which sort of inanimate
creatures the north part of this parish aboundeth.
It takes its denomination from the manor and barton of
old Cardinham; as from thence did its lord and owner
Robert de Cardinan, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, the same gentleman
mentioned in Mr. Carew’s “Survey of Cornwall,”
that by the tenure of knight-service held in those parts
seventy-one knight’s fees; which undoubtedly then was
the greatest estate pertaining to any private man in this
province. He was not only the founder and endower of
the Alien Priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew at Tywardreth, (of which
more in that place,) but also of this rectory church.
By the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester
into the value of benefices in Cornwall, as
aforesaid, 1294, Ecclesia de Cardinan in Decanatu de
Westwellshire, was rated 6<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>

17<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
6<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>,
by the name of the Rectory of Cardenham, synonymous
with Cardinham. The patronage in the Lord
Dynham’s heir, Arundell, and others; the incumbent,
Waddon; this parish was taxed to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound

161<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> 8<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span></p>

<p>And here it must be observed, that there was no such
parish or church extant at the time of the Norman
conquest as Cardinham; for in the Domesday Rate,
1087, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, this division passed then under the
<!--206.png--><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
districts of Cabulian, Dovenot, and Glin, (see the
Domesday Catalogue); but after the building and
endowing of this church, Glin was converted into
Cardinham parish, and Cabulian into Warliggon; under
which name and title they have hitherto passed,
as members thereof. I find it much controverted
amongst antiquaries and historians, whether the Dynhams,
that afterwards became possessed of this manor
and barton, were the descendants of this Robert de
Cardinan, or not; some averring one thing and some
another; but certain I am they were possessed thereof
as his heirs and assigns; but whether denominated
from thence, or the local places of Dynham in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Menvor, or Dinham-bridge in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, I know not.
Nevertheless, contrary to both those conjectures, Mr.
Camden tells us that those Dinhams were a French
tribe that came into England with William the Conqueror;
particularly one Oliver de Dinant, one of whose
sons, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Galfrid de Dinham, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was
a great augmenter of the Abbey of Hartland; and
changed the secular priests founded there by Githa,
wife of Earl Godwin, into Black Canons Augustine.
See Monasticon Anglicanum, in Devon.</p>

<p>One Oliver de Dinant, or Dinham, was by writ of
summons called to Parliament as a Baron, 24 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
who had issue Josce, who had issue John, who had
issue John, who had issue John, who had issue John;
who were all knighted; which last John had issue, by
Sir Richard Arche’s heir, John Dinham, of Old Cardenham,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, sheriff of Devon, 39 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, 1460,
who then resided at his barton of Nutwell, in Woodberry
parish, eight miles from Exeter, who at that time
made use of his authority in promoting the safety of
the Duke of York’s friends, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the Earls of March,
Salisbury, and Warwick, and others, then attainted
of treason by Act of Parliament, who, in order to
the preservation of their lives, fled into Devonshire,
<!--207.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
where they were concealed by the said John Dinham
at Nutwell aforesaid, till he had opportunities from
Exmouth to convey them to Guernsey, from whence
they were transported to Calais, which place they
secured for the Duke of York. But as soon as King
Henry and the Parliament understood thereof, immediately
the Duke of Somerset was dispatched with
a commission to be governor of that place; who no
sooner approached the harbour of Calais with his ships,
but those fugitive lords ordered the train of artillery
at Rysbank (there) immediately to be fired upon the
Duke of Somerset and his companions, as they were
coming on shore, which so obstructed their design that
they were forced, with some damage and loss, to return
to their ships, weigh anchor, spread sails, and bear off
for the English coast, and dropped anchor safely at
Sandwich in Kent; from whence King Henry and
Queen Margaret had some notice from the Duke of
Somerset of the affront offered his Majesty and him at
Calais, whereupon the King ordered his navy royal, as
soon as possible, to be in readiness to attend and assist
him, in order to reduce Calais to his obedience.</p>

<p>But, alas! maugre those contrivance, the said John
Dynham, before the King’s navy could be provided and
got together, out of affection to the Duke of York, the
Earl of March and his confederates, like a daring,
valiant, courageous, and invincible hero, as he was,
with a small company of armed men, boarded the Earl
of Somerset’s ships in the harbour of Sandwich, and
therein took the Lord Rivers, designed for his admiral
against Calais, and by a strong hand carried him and
all his ships thither; and then, with the same ships,
conveyed the Earl of March and his friends from Calais
to the Duke of York his father, then fled into Ireland.</p>

<p>After the restoration of the House of York to the
crown, in the person of Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> we find this John
Dynham was knighted. In the 6th Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> he was
<!--208.png--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>
by writ summoned to Parliament as a Baron thereof, by
the name of John Dinham, Baron Dinham, of Cardinham.
In the 9th Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> he obtained a grant of the
custody of the forest of Dartmoor, the manor and
borough of Lidford, and the manor of South Teign in
Devon, during his life, under the yearly rent of 100
marks, and 6<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span>
8<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>; and soon after he got a grant of the
office of steward of the honours, castles, manors, and
boroughs of Plympton, Oakhampton, Tiverton, Sampford
Courtney, and some others, and was made Knight
of the Garter; and in the first year of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, 1485,
he was by letters patent created Baron Dinham, of
Cardinham; afterwards he was made Lord High Treasurer
of England, which office he held fifteen years, and
died 17 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> aged seventy-two years. He left
issue Charles Dinham, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his son and heir, sheriff of
Devon, 16 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, 1476, that married Elizabeth,
daughter and heir of Lord Fitzwalter, who died without
issue; by reason whereof his four sisters became his heirs,
and were married, Jane, to Baron Zouch, of Totness;
Joan, to Lord Arundell, of Lanherne, knight; Margaret,
to Nicholas Baron Carew, of Molesford, in Berkshire;
and Elizabeth, to Foulk Bourchier, of Tavistock,
Lord Fitzwarren. The arms of Dinham were, in a field
Gules, three fusils in fess Argent, within a border
Ermine; but Nicholas Upton, in his manuscript of
heraldry, 1440, written before the invention of printing,
tells us, Monsieur Oliver de Dinham port de Goules
un fess engrelle de Ermine, un bordure endentee Argent.</p>

<p>The Lady Elizabeth Dinham, widow of the Lord
Fitzwarren aforesaid, after his death, was married to
Thomas Shapcott, of Elton, in Huntingdonshire, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>,
where, at her own proper cost and charge, she erected a
private chapel to the honour of Almighty God, of that
curious and costly workmanship, both in walls, roof,
and window, that it is worthy the admiration of all
beholders, and parallel to, if not superior, to any other
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
church or chapel of its bigness in England. See Camden
in Huntingdonshire.</p>

<p>Nicholas Baron Carew aforesaid, together with his
lady, were buried in Westminster Abbey, amongst the
kings and queens of England, as appears from a grey
marble tomb-stone, with a brass inscription round it,
containing, as I remember, these words.</p>

“formerly at Cardinham lived the Lord Dinham.”</p>

<p>Glin, Glynn, in this parish, is a name taken and
given from the ancient natural circumstances of the
place, where lakes, pools, and rivers of water abound,
and groves of trees, or copps, flourish and grow; derived
from the Japhetical Greek λιμνη, [limnee] lacus;
under which name, and devyock, or deynock district,
part of the now parish of Cardinham, was taxed
20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, 1087. From which place was denominated
an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed De
Glynn, who for many generations flourished there in
worshipful degree, till about the time of Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>,
when the sole daughter and heir of this family was
married to Carmynow of Resprin, or Polmaugan, whose
heir being married to Courtney, brought this barton of
Glynn into that family; by some of whose posterity it
was sold to a younger branch of this family of Glynn,
who thereby was restated therein, and so became possessed
thereof; from whom was lineally descended
Nicholas Glynn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Member of Parliament for Bodmin,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, who married one of the coheirs
of Dennis, of Orleigh, in Devon, as did Sir Thomas
Hamson, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr>, of Buckinghamshire, the other; who
<!--210.png--><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>
had issue Denny Glynn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married two wives,
<a name="foow" id="foow"></a>Foow of Tiverton, and Hoblyn of Bodman; who had
issue William Glynn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, that married Prideaux of
Padstow, and giveth for his arms, in a field Argent, a
chevron between three salmon-spears Sable; alluding
to their custom, privilege, or right of hunting or fishing
for salmons in the Fowey river, passing through this
barton or lordship of Glynn towards the sea. Mr. Carew,
in his Survey of Cornwall, tells us this place is called
Glynford, by reason of a bridge or pass over the Fowey
River there; for ford in British signifies a street, road,
pass, or highway over waters; but the authority of
Domesday Roll aforesaid, which calls it Glin, plainly
shows that this latter appellation, ford, was added to
this word Glynn after the bridge aforesaid was erected,
and not otherwise to be applied. Nicholas Glynn, of
Glyn-ford, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was sheriff of Cornwall 18 James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>Devynock, as aforesaid, was another district now in
this parish, taxed in Domesday Roll, now in possession
of &mdash;&mdash; Hann, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has not any thing of the least curiosity
that differs from Hals. He ends indeed by saying,
that “nothing can be more ridiculous than Mr. Hals’s
derivation of the name of this parish.”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>It is much to be wished that some one learned in the
Celtic language, perhaps a native of Britany, would
investigate the derivations of all the names of places,
of hills, and of rivers, after visiting their localities.</p>

<p>Car, in composition, is probably the same as cairn or
kairn a rock, and din is a fortress; but these do not
seem likely to take up the Saxon termination ham, an
house or dwelling.</p>

<p><!--211.png--><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pageno">173</span>
Glynn has not, in all probability, any connection
with the Saxon words gline or glen. A word of very
similar sound in one of the Celtic dialects denominates
a spear, and this agrees with the family arms, which are
Argent, the heads of three fishing-spears or tridents,
with their points downwards, two and one, Sable. A
new house was built at Glynn by Mr. Edmund John
Glynn, son of Serjeant Glynn, distinguished in the
political dissensions of Mr. Wilkes. The house was
accidentally consumed by fire before the whole interior
had been completed. The walls, however, were not
much injured, and the building will probably be restored.
It is now the property of the Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Gen.
Sir Hussey Vivian.</p>

<p>Serjeant Glynn succeeded to his elder brother’s son,
a young man said to be possessed of considerable
abilities and even learning, but of such singular and
eccentric habits, that he remained for years without
speaking a single word, communicating his thoughts
by writing. A verdict of lunacy was at last obtained
against him at the Cornwall Assizes, but much to the
general dissatisfaction of the country, as interested
motives were readily imputable to the uncle; and his
mother felt so strongly on the subject, that being
heiress of an ancient family, Nicholls of Trewane in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kew, she devised nearly the whole of her possessions,
in honour of her son’s name, to Mr. Glynn of
Heliton; probably of the same stock, but very distantly
related.</p>

<p>This parish measures 7750 statute acres.</p>

GEOLOGY, BY DOCTOR BOASE.</p>

<p>A continuation of the granite of Blisland and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Breward forms the north-eastern corner of this parish.
A belt then succeeds, which appears to be of the same
kind as the micaceous slate of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breward already described;
it may be traced along the side of the Leskeard
road in a disintegrated state. On leaving this
road and proceeding towards the church, the rock becomes
more argillaceous, as round Bodmin, and the
land improves in quality. The western and southern
parts of the parish consist of barren downs, reposing on
rocks which abound in quartz.</p>

<p>The name of this parish is taken from the church,
and the church’s name from the titular guardianess
thereof, to whom the same is dedicated, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
or Cleer; whose name is derived from the Latin word
claro, i. e. clear, bright, shining, transparent; and she
herself was born of an honourable lineage at the city of
Assisum in Italy.</p>

<p>[Mr. Hals here gives a long history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare, much
more in detail than is suited to a parochial history.</p>

<p>It may be sufficient to add, she was the daughter of
Phavorino Sciffo, a noble knight, and of Hortulana, his
most virtuous wife, and born in the year 1193. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Francis was then alive and at the height of his fame.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominic and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, as is well known, instituted
the two great orders of begging monks or
friars. Those who entered into any of the previously
existing monastic establishments, underwent what was
termed a civil death, renounced all individual property,
bestowing what was at their own disposal in any way
most agreeable to themselves, and suffering what was
inalienable to descend to their heirs. Hence has originated
the expression natural life, as opposed to civil
life, still used in legal proceedings. But <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominic
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, not content with this individual poverty,
extended it to their orders; so that with the exception
of a dwelling, some furniture, and necessary
raiment, their friars were to live, as the cynics had done
of old, upon the accidental charity of victuals given in
kind and from day to day; for a broad and impassable
boundary was drawn between receiving bread from the
donor’s hand, and a piece of metal for which that bread
might be procured; in the same manner as any portion
of the increase arising from flocks or herds might lawfully
be given; whilst anathemas were thundered
against him who accepted the least return for valuable
commodity, in exchange for which similar flocks
or herds could easily and freely be procured.</p>

<p>As impassioned harangues were obviously the most
efficient agents for eliciting or extorting these daily
<!--214.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
alms, they were incessantly employed; so that the mendicants
soon acquired the distinctive appellation of
preaching friars; and the whole institution being suited
to the genius, the spirit, and the prejudices of the rude
age in which it arose, the Dominicans and Franciscans
acquired and maintained, during some centuries, almost
the temporal sovereignty of Europe; till their dissentions,
the scandalous immorality growing out of their
vagrant lives, and the diffusion of knowledge, dissolved
the charm.</p>

<p>This contagion readily extended itself to females, so
that, with some indispensible modifications, societies soon
arose of women bound by the same rule of individual
and collective poverty. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare appears to have been
the first female disciple of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, or at least the
first raised by him to eminence and power, acquisitions
far more captivating to the human mind, than wealth
with all its passive luxuries and enjoyments.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare had the gratification of eloping from her
parents to receive the veil and the tonsure from the
hands of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, who placed her at first in a monastery
of Benedictine Nuns; but the young saint soon
found herself in the situation of an abbess, with her
mother and two sisters members of the community,
submitted to her sway. From this station she advanced
to be the founder of an order, having numerous houses
established under her supreme authority, exercised according
to rules dictated by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis; and the poor
Clares constitute a principal branch of the female monastic
establishments existing in all Catholic countries
up to the present times.</p>

<p>Pope Innocent <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> made a journey on purpose to
visit Clare, not long before her death in 1253, and again
to assist at her funeral. His successor, Pope Alexander
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> two years afterwards, inscribed her name in the
celestial canon. Mr. Hals then proceeds to particulars.]</p>

<p><!--215.png--><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
In this parish is yet to be seen a famous chapel Well,
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clare, a work of great skill, labour, and
cost, though now much decayed, which formerly pertained
to some nunnery of those sort of religious women
extant here or at Leskeard. (See Truro and Kenwyn,
for Clares.) From this parish was denominated
an ancient family of gentlemen, surnamed de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleare,
from whence are descended the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clears of Tudwell,
in Devon, who, suitable to their name, give for their
arms, in a field Azure the sun in its glory shining or
transparent; of which tribe was that Robertus de Sancto
Claro, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui tenet decem libratas terræ, in hundredo de
Mertock, in comit. Somerset, de domine rege in capite,
per servicium inveniendi unum servientem armatum cum
uno equo in exercitu domini regis in Wallia per xl.
dies sumptibus suis propriis.</span> (Pleas of the Crown in
Scaccario, 8 Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>)</p>

<p>In this parish is Tre-worg-y, the mansion of John
Conock, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, that married Burgoigne; his father
Heale and Courtney; and giveth for his arms, Argent,
a fess dancette between three spread eagles Gules.</p>

<p>The name Conock or Connock signifies rich, prosperous,
thriving, successful, of which name and family
those in Cornwall are descended from the Conocks of
Wiltshire, and the first propagator of this tribe in those
parts was one Mr. Conock, who in the time of Queen
Elizabeth came to Leskeard town a tanner, and in that
occupation got much riches, and laid the foundation of
his estate, as Mr. Thomas River, of Liskeard, informed
me.</p>

<p>Tre-mabe, in this parish, id est, the son’s town, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a
place in former ages by some father given as the dwelling
to his son, was formerly the lands of Samuel Langford,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Cary of Clovelly.</p>

<p>Tre-wor-oc, also Tre-wor-ock, the town on a lake, was
formerly the lands of Trubody, who sold the same to
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
Jackman, now in possession thereof. In the church
on seats or pews, pertaining to those Trubodys, I have
seen this inscription, Nati honoris; in what sense to
be construed is mystery to me, since I have not understood
that any of this tribe was either a son nobly born,
or inherited to any kind of honour, dignity, or promotion.</p>

<p>At Pennant in this parish, id est, the head of the
valley, or the valley head, in the open downs by the
high road or street-way, formerly stood a large flat
moor-stone, about eight feet long, in perpendicular manner,
described by Mr. Carew and Mr. Camden, wherein
is still to be seen on the one side thereof this inscription,
in Roman Saxon letters, then in use when it was set up,
containing these words: doniert rogauit pro anima.</p>

<p>[Instead of the long and uninteresting account given
by Mr. Hals of this monument, I will take the liberty
of substituting an extract from Mr. Bond’s Topographical
and Historical Sketches of the Boroughs of East
and West Looe, printed by J. Nichols and Son, Parliament
Street, in 1823, which will be found of a very
different description.]</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Not far from Dosmery Pool may be seen a curious
heap of rocks, called Wring Cheese or Cheese Wring;
and, at a short distance therefrom, an artificial curiosity
called the Hurlers, and another called the Other-half-stone.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Camden, in his Britannia, speaking of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Neot’s
parish, says, ‘Near unto this, as I have heard, within
the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer, there are to be seen, in a place
called Pennant, that is, the head of the vale, two monuments
of stone; of which the one in the upper part
is wrought hollow, in manner of a chair; the other,
named Other-halfe-stone, hath an inscription of barbarous
characters, now in a manner worn out,’ which he
thinks should be read thus: <span class="muchsmaller">DONIERT ROGAVIT PRO</span>
<!--217.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
<span class="muchsmaller">ANIMA</span>. As for this Doniert, Camden thinks he was
that prince of Cornwall whom the chroniclers name
Dungerth, and record that he was drowned in the year
of our salvation 872. Camden also says, ‘Hard by
there is a number of good big rockes heaped up together;
and under them one stone of a lesser size, fashioned
naturally in form of a cheese, so as it seemeth
to be pressed like a cheese; whereupon it is named
Wring Cheese. Many other stones besides, in some
sort four-square, are to be seen upon the plain adjoining;
of which seven or eight are pitched upright of
equal distances asunder. The neighbouring inhabitants
term them Hurlers, as being by a devout and godly
error persuaded, they had been men sometime transformed
into stones, for profaning the Lord’s day with
hurling the ball. Others would have it to be a trophy
(as it were) or a monument in memorial of some battle.
And some think verily they were set as mere stones or
landmarks; as having read in those authors that wrote
on limits, that stones were gathered together of both
parties, and the same erected for bounders. In this
coast the river Loo maketh way and runneth into the
sea, and in his very mouth giveth name to two little
towns joined with a bridge together.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the 6th August, 1802, I went with a party of
friends to see these natural and artificial curiosities,
mentioned by Camden. I first got the party to
Red-gate,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer parish, about four miles from Liskeard,
in order to find out Doniert or Dungerth’s monument,
which I understood was somewhere near to it. I
made inquiry at the house at Red-gate after this monument,
but could get no account of it for some time,
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
though I questioned in a variety of ways; at last, however,
we got information where it was situated. It is
about a quarter of a mile off from Red-gate, eastward,
in a field next the high road. We got into this field,
and seeing an erect stone went towards it, and found it
to be the monument we sought. One moorstone stands
erect, and the other with the inscription on it, lies in a
pit close by. The figures of these stones in Borlase’s
History are most like them of any I have
seen.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span>
I
made out and copied the inscription very perfectly, by
rubbing a soft stone which left its mark in the letters.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“This stone by recollection is about two feet wide at
top, and about five or six feet in length. And the other
stone, which still stands erect, and ornamented with
cross lines, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> is about the same in height.</p>


<p class="blockquote"><!--219.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
“The west front is quite plain; the top has the remains
of a kind of mortice, left hand corner broken off. The
east front is dotted over, but has no letters.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I find in Hals, that the pit in which the stone with the
inscription lies, was formed in the latter end of the reign
of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> in consequence of his, Hals’s, going there
at that period with some gentlemen, to view, as he says,
the, at that time thought barbarous, inscription; for
some tinners in the contiguous country, taking notice of
these gentlemen visiting this place, apprehended they
came there in quest of some hidden treasure; whereupon,
as Hals says, some of them wiser than the rest,
lay their heads together, and resolved in council to be
before-hand, and accordingly went with pickaxes and
shovels, and opened the earth round about the monument,
to the depth of about six feet; when they discovered
a spacious vault walled about, and arched over
with stones, having on the sides thereof two stone seats,
not unlike those in churches for auricular confession.
The sight of all which struck them with consternation,
or a kind of horror, that they incontinently gave over
search, and with the utmost hurry and dread, throwing
earth and turf to fill up the pit they made, they departed,
having neither of them the courage to enter or even to
inspect into the further circumstances of the place;
which account Hals says, he had from the mouths of
some of the very fellows themselves. Some short while
after, the loose earth, by reason of some heavy rains
which fell, sunk away into the vault, which occasioning
also a sort of terræ-motus and concession of the earth
adjoining, the said monument was at length so undermined
thereby, that it fell to the ground, where it still
remains. Would some gentlemen of ability and curiosity,
says Hals, and so say I, be at the charge of
again opening and cleansing this under-ground
chapel, or whatever else it may be denominated, it
might probably afford matter of pleasing amusement, if
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
not grand speculation to the learned searchers into matters
of antiquity.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“This monument formerly went by the name of ‘the
other half stone.’ Some translate the inscription,
‘Pray for the soul of Dungerth,’ others ‘Doniert asked
for his soul;’ and there seems to be great controversy
for what purpose this monument was erected. High
stones might originally, in the early ages of Christianity,
have been erected near roads in desolate situations, and
at short distances from each other, to direct travellers in
their journies; and crosses might have been placed on
them as a memento for thanksgiving, when the traveller
had effected this part of his journey in safety. Now if
the inscription on the above monument is meant for
‘Pray for the soul of Dungerth,’ may we not suppose
that it was meant as a request to those who should happen
to be praying for themselves, to offer up a prayer
also for Dungerth, who probably caused that monument
to be erected, or who was buried near the same,
perhaps in the chapel before mentioned to have been
discovered by the tinners. Or if the inscription is to be
read, ‘Doniert asked for his soul,’ which seems the
proper translation; may we not suppose that Doniert
(who by all accounts was a very pious prince) erected
this stone, and prayed or asked for mercy thereat. Perhaps
originally these stones might have been called Ave
stones, from the Latin word ‘Ave,’ all hail! God speed
you; God save you, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> a very appropriate expression
in a desolate situation to a wanderer or traveller. And
the reference to another Ave stone might signify the one
which is a little to the eastward of it, bearing a cross,
and by its appearance formerly a legend underneath.
This word Ave (pronounced in the same manner it is in
Ave-Mary-Lane, London) might be corrupted into Half;
so that Ave stone and Half stone might mean one and
the same thing. And in Cornwall the F is very frequently
pronounced as a V, and the V as an F, at this
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>
present time.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
If this does not meet approbation, I will
add another conjecture. As the circle of stones called
the Hurlers, are at a short distance from this monument
and the cross before-mentioned, might not the monument
and the cross be called the ‘one heave stone,’ and
the other, ‘the other or outer heave stone,’ places from
whence the ball during the game of hurling was thrown.
The traditionary story of the stones called the hurlers,
being once men turned into stone for profaning the Sabbath,
will give some slight sanction to this conjecture;
and in addition, even at this time the high-cross is vulgarly
believed to have been the man who ran off with
the ball.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“With respect to the stones called the Hurlers being
once men, I will say with Hals, ‘Did but the ball
which these Hurlers used when flesh and blood, appear
directly over them immoveably pendant in the air, one
might be apt to credit some little of the tale;’ but as
this is not the case, I must add my belief of their being
erected by the Druids for some purpose or other, probably
a court of justice; long subsequent to which
erection, however, they may have served as the goal for
hurl players. And indeed a finer spot for such a game
could not be fixed on perhaps any where. But I believe
the Hurlers took their names from some other
source than that of the game of hurling the ball being
used there.</p>

<!--222.png--><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
<p class="blockquote">“After sufficiently viewing Dungerth’s monument, we
directed our course towards Cheese-wring, and soon
came to the Hurlers, but first we rode up to the High
Cross before mentioned, which at a distance looked
somewhat like a man. Under its cross it has an oblong
square, as if the border of an inscription, but at present
there is not the least vestige of a letter on it. Soon
after we came to the Hurlers, which we found to be
moorstones of about five or six feet high, forming two
circles one without the other (not as represented in Hals’
Parochial History, but like that in Borlase), the circle
nearest Cheese-wring less than that of the other. Some
of the stones are fallen down, and remain where they fell,
and others have probably been carried off for gate posts
and other purposes. The areas of the circles are not
level, there being many pits in them, as if the earth had
sunk over large graves. I confess I was not much
struck with the appearance of these famous stones, not
having faith to believe they once were men. Near this
place we fell in with a man going to Cheese-wring, and
were glad to follow him as a guide. Among other
questions, I asked him, as we passed along, whether he
could tell me the name of the tenement on which Dungerth’s
monument was; he answered Pennant. I also
asked him whether he knew where the source of the
Looe river was; he said in a field next below Dungerth’s
monument. I was sorry to hear this, as we could not
conveniently return to see it, but I learned from him it
was a mere spring of water uninclosed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“When we reached Cheese-wring, we discovered a man
and woman on the top of the mount (on the declivity of
which Cheese-wring stands), who, we afterwards found,
were cutting turfs for fuel. Our guide first led us to the
house of the late Daniel Gumb (a stone-cutter), cut by
him out of a solid rock of granite (the rocks all around
this place are granite, or moorstone as commonly called
in Cornwall, and of the finest quality). This artificial
<!--223.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
cavern may be about twelve feet deep and not quite so
broad; the roof consists of one flat stone of many tons
weight, supported by the natural rock on one side, and
by pillars of small stones on the other. How Gumb
formed this last support is not easily conceived. We
entered with hesitation lest the covering should be our
grave-stone. On the right-hand side of the door is ‘D.
Gumb,’ with a date engraved 1735 (or 3). On the
upper part of the covering stone, channels are cut to
carry off the rain, or probably to cause it to fall into a
bucket for his use; there is also engraved on it some
geometrical device formed by Gumb, as our guide told
us, who also said that Gumb was accounted a pretty
sensible man. I have no hesitation in saying he must
have been a pretty eccentric character to have fixed on
this place for his habitation; but here he dwelt for several
years with his wife and children, several of whom
were born and died here. His calling was that of a
stone-cutter, and he fixed himself on a spot where materials
could be met with to employ a thousand men for
a thousand years.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“After quitting this house, we ascended a few paces to
the pile of rocks called Cheese-wring, the resemblance
of which is well expressed by the print in Borlase’s Nat.
Hist. We were all struck with astonishment at this
wonderful work of nature; we surveyed it over and over
again, went round it several times, and viewed it from
every part. It is about thirty-two feet high. The uppermost
stone I have no doubt has Druidical basons
formed in it. One of them shows itself by the edge of
the stone having fallen away. After spending some
time in viewing this tremendously awful pile of rocks,
we ascended to the summit of the mount on the side of
which it stands. This summit is surrounded by an artificial
rampart of loose stones, not piled up; possibly
they might have formed a wall, or have been carried
there for building one; for if they were placed as they
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pageno">186</span>
now are with an intention so to remain, they could not
have been very defensive to this mount. Possibly the
name of Cheese-wring may be derived from this ring of
stones, and not from the vulgar idea of the Cheese-wring
rocks being like a cheese-press.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The area within the rampart may be about half an
acre of ground, and has rocks scattered all over it; but
in some places verdure even in this rude region makes
its appearance. We found a man and a woman within
the area cutting turfs between the rocks for fuel. Among
other questions, I asked the man to whom the spot belonged;
his answer was, ‘he believed to nobody.’</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Several curious piles of rocks, some forming cromlechs,
and others of various forms and positions, are
here also to be seen, and several of them have Druidical
basons on them. The rocks having these basons are
the most lofty or most remarkable for shape or situation.
On some rocks there are two or three basons; and where
there are more basons than one, they generally communicate
by a channel. The basons here are of different
sizes, though all of them are of the same shape, which
is circular. Some of them are about a foot and a half
in diameter, and six or eight inches deep; others
not so large or deep. Never having seen any Druidical
basons before, and having had my doubts till
this time, whether they might not be natural productions
caused by rain, lightning, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> I was led
to examine other rocks, whether they had (though
equally exposed to the weather) similar formations, but
could not find a bason on any rock that was not singular
either for its shape or situation. I therefore concluded
that these basons were the work of art, and not of nature;
and I think they were not intended for the purpose of
receiving the rain for common uses, for if so, why were
they not made on rocks of easy access? It is possible,
however, that rain being held in a natural hollow of a
rock, may decompose that part of the rock on which it
rests, and being whirled about by the wind from time to
<!--225.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pageno">187</span>
time, may form these basons which we attribute to art;
and if this is the case, they must continue increasing in
size and depth. Have such basons ever been seen but
on granite rocks? if not, probably water dissolves the
feltspar and disunites the quartz and mica; and the
winds driving round the water with particles of quartz
at the bottom of the bason, must consequently fret away
the rock and enlarge the bason. A rock of white
marble lies on the sea-beach near Looe, completely covered
with hollows like what are termed Druidical basons;
these hollows in this rock I have no doubt have
been formed by the sea; it lies near an insulated
high rock under Sanders Lane, and is every tide covered
with the sea, and is very frequently covered with
sand. A person fancying the basons on this rock
of marble to be an artificial work, might also fancy that
it once was placed on top of the elevated rock near it;
the contrast of the white marble on top of the elevated
rock, which is of a very dark colour, would give a singular
appearance. When this high rock is shown to
strangers, they are generally told, with a serious face,
that when it hears a cock crowing at Hay (which is a
farm just above it) it turns round three times!</p>

<p class="p2 center small">“SHARPY TORRY.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“After leaving the area before-mentioned, we mounted
our horses, and went towards another very considerable
rocky eminence, about half a mile north-east; the road
to which over the Down is full of rocks and stones, so
as to prevent a horse from going other than step and
step at times. On our way we passed a small circle of
stones, the remains I rather think of an ancient Barrow,
whose earth had been washed away by the rains. We
shortly after passed another pretty large circle of stones,
just about the diameter to appearance of the lesser
circle of the Hurlers; at length we arrived at the pile of
rocks, called by our guide Sharpy-torry (Sharp-torr, from
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pageno">188</span>
its conical shape). We alighted from our horses and ascended.
On the north or north-west side of it there appears
a hollow, more like a large chimney than any other
thing I can compare it to; the outside of which seems
to have given way, and the steep hill below is strewed
with an immense quantity of rocks and large stones, as
if carried down or poured out from this hollow. Whether
this was caused by the operation of fire or water
bursting from this hollow or crater, if I may use the expression,
I will not take upon me to say; but that one
or other of these agents burst from this mount appears
to be extremely probable, for the rocks and stones seem
exactly as if they had been tumbled or thrown out of
this crater by a current of some kind. We could not,
however, discover lava; therefore it is probable water
might have burst out, unless the lava has been decomposed.
The views from this place are truly sublime.
The spot is nearly the centre of the broadest part of the
county; from it we saw both seas, north and south, and
consequently the intervening land; and I believe it is the
only eminence (except perhaps Brownwilly) in the eastern
part of Cornwall, from whence both seas may be
seen. We also saw in the North Sea a very high land,
which we concluded must be Lundy Island; but the horizon
to the north being rather hazy, I will not take
upon me to say positively that it was that island,
though it is probable to have been so. The prospect
was equally extensive east and west, and as I took a
pocket spying-glass with me, we viewed therewith the
vast extent we commanded. We discovered Launceston
Castle with the naked eye; through the glass it became
very visible. We were much struck with the beautiful
and highly-cultivated lands to the east of us, terminated
in part by the high land of Dartmoor. To the
westward, nothing was to be seen but a vast continuance
of moor land, without a hedge, without a tree, for a
stretch of many miles. The cultivated land commenced
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
just below our feet to the eastward, and the uncultivated
from where we stood westward; the contrast on turning
from west to east, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>, was astonishing. Our
station seemed to be amidst the wreck of mountains of
granite, rocks piled on rocks were strewed around in
awful grandeur. The extreme point of our western view,
dimmed by distance, showed us that elevated rock called
Roach Rock, and we also saw Dosmerry Pool about
four or five miles off; our south view commanded Plymouth
Sound, and a long extent of coast and sea; the
northward in one part was terminated by the sea. The
views brought to my mind the beautiful lines in Ovid:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i0a">“Tum freta diffundi, rapidisque tumescere ventis</div>
  <div class="i0">Jussit, et ambitæ circumdare littora terræ.</div>
  <div class="i0">Addidit et fontes, immensaque stagna lacusque.</div>
  <div class="i0">Jussit et extendi campos, subsidere valles,</div>
  <div class="i0">Fronde tegi silvas, lapidosos surgere montes.”</div>
</div>

<p class="blockquote small">“Then he ordered the seas to poured abroad, and to swell with furious winds,
and to draw a shore quite round the inclosed earth. He likewise added springs,
and immense pools and lakes. He ordered likewise plains to be extended, and
valleys to sink; the woods to be covered with green leaves, and the rocky
mountains to rise.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“From this elevated spot (Sharp Tor) Hingston Hill
appeared considerably beneath us. After spending
some time on Sharp Tor, we reluctantly descended and
went towards another range of rocks, called Killmarth
Hill (which signifies the Holy Hill or Land, or perhaps
Holy Grove), about three-quarters of a mile off. This
range of rocks looks from Sharp Tor, like an immense
wall of artificial masonry, with here and there turrets
ascending, and it brought to my mind Sir George
Staunton’s account of the Chinese wall. When we arrived
at its base, we alighted from our horses, and ascended.
This natural wall-looking range is composed
of granite rocks of, I should suppose some of them, a
thousand tons weight. We traversed along the ridge,
with some difficulty, towards the first turret, and from
<!--228.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
that to the next and so on, but the highest, which at a
distance looked somewhat like Wringcheese, was yet to
be explored; at length we arrived at it, and found it, if
possible, more curious than Cheese-wring itself. It
consists of immense rocks piled one on the other, to the
height of twenty or thirty feet, and it leans so much,
that a perpendicular dropped from its top would, I may
venture to say, reach the bottom fifteen or more feet
from its base; and from where we stood on the ridge, its
support at the base appeared so slight as if a man could
shove the whole mass over the precipice. Some of the
uppermost stones of this pile are, I should think, from
fifteen to twenty feet over, and the base of the whole
fabric appeared so slight, that I imagined the handle of
my whip would have exceeded its thickness. Upon
descending to take another view of this astonishing
structure, we found that the rocks were considerably
thicker on one side than the other; so that the thick
parts formed a counterpoise to the overhanging parts;
but this not being apparent from the spot on which we
first stood, was the cause of our great astonishment.
However, though our astonishment was somewhat lessened,
yet much remained at this stupendous pile. This
is the most western turret.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“From this place one of the party and myself, the
others not chusing to accompany us, went to explore
the easternmost turret. Upon our arrival at its base we
found much difficulty in ascending it; the rocks jutted
out, one over the other, in such a manner that, had we
slipped but a few inches, we must have dropped over a
considerable precipice. I arrived first at the base, and
attempted to ascend, but fear pulled me back. Upon
my friend’s arrival we thought we would exert ourselves
to get up, as we conjectured there might be a Druidical
basin at top. My friend got up the first rock by creeping
at full length under the overhanging rock; and I
was under the necessity of several times desiring him,
<!--229.png--><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
in the most energetic manner, to keep as close in as possible;
for if the body had gone a few inches farther out,
it must have slid over the sloping rock which overhung
the precipice. It took him a few minutes to drag himself
in in this manner. In this creeping state he thought
he should have broken his watch to pieces, as he was
obliged, as before stated, to crawl at full length, there
being no possibility; on account of the overhanging
rock, of going on hands and knees. Upon trying to get
out his watch, I earnestly entreated him to desist, for
fear of losing his centre of gravity; for on the left hand
was the precipice, and raising his right side ever so little
might have been attended with most serious consequences.
He took my advice, and by another exertion
got far enough in to raise himself on his hands and
knees, and then on his legs. I then followed him in
the same manner. We then examined the rocks above
us, in order to observe the best mode of ascending them.
I first made the ascent, and in the uppermost rock discovered
the largest Druidical basin we had met with,
and observed it had a lip or channel facing the south.
The horrid precipices on each side prevented my getting
on the top of this rock, as I felt a slight vertigo. I
then got down on a lower rock, and my friend ascended
the uppermost one, and not finding himself dizzy, got
into the basin itself (where I hope he will never go
again), and waved his hat to our companions below. I
desired him to measure the circumference of this basin,
which he did with his whip, and found it to be about
three feet and a half in diameter. We did not take its
depth, but I think it must have been about a foot; it was
of a circular form. The next thing to be considered
was, how we should get down again; which at last,
however, we effected nearly in the same manner (only
reversing our movements) as we got up; and I believe
nothing will ever induce me to pay a second visit to the
top of this rock.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--230.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pageno">192</span>
“We had a very fine day for our excursion; the sun
being clouded, it was not over warm; and there was but
little wind: had there been more wind, we should not
have been able to ascend some of the places we did,
particularly the last. The air was somewhat hazy over
the North and South seas, which was the only thing we
had to regret.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A finer situation for
Druidical<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_29" id="fnanchor_29"></a><a href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></span>
residence, rites, and
<!--231.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
ceremonies, I think, could not be fixed on anywhere;
every thing around is awfully magnificent; probably in
ancient days these masses of rocks were surrounded with
trees. Our guide indeed informed us that on digging
the soil trunks of large trees have been there discovered;
and Kil-mar, Kill-mark, Kil-marth signify, in Cornish,
the Great, the Horse, or the Wonderful Grove.”</p>

<p>Since writing the above, I have been again to see
these curiosities (but did not visit the top of the easternmost
turret), and went by the way of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer Churchtown,
near which is a curious old well, with a moorstone
cross by it, worth seeing; the stone itself is in form
of a cross, and it has a cross in relief cut on its cross.
About a mile from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer Church (on the way to
Cheese Wring) stands a most magnificent</p>

<p class="p2 center small">CROMLECH,</p>

<p class="unindent">on a barrow in a field near the high road, on the tenement
called Trethevye. A friend who was with me took
a rough measurement of the upper or covering stone,
and calculated it to be about five tons weight. The
stones which form this Cromlech are supposed to have
<!--232.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pageno">194</span>
been brought some miles from where they stand, as
there are none of the same kind near it. That this is a
work of art there cannot be a doubt. One can hardly,
however, suppose it possible that such immense stones
could have been brought from a distance, and erected
in the manner they are. What machinery was used
baffles all conjecture. The upper or covering stone has
a hole in it; for what purpose I have no idea, unless to
support a flag-pole. One of the party remarked it
might have been made for a chain to drag it by; but I
rather thought it too near the edge for that purpose.
Mr. Britton, in his “Beauties of England and Wales,”
has given a vignette of this Cromlech, which is well
executed, and like the original. Speaking of this Cromlech,
Mr. B. says, he believes it has not been described by
any writer,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_30" id="fnanchor_30"></a><a href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></span>
though it is more curious and of greater magnitude
than that of Mona, or any other he was acquainted
with. He says “it standeth about one mile and a half
east of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer, on an eminence commanding an extensive
tract of country, particularly to the east, south,
and south-west; and is provincially denominated Trevethey
Stone. On the north the high ground of the
Moors exalts its swelling outline above it. It is all of
granite, and consists of six upright stones, and one large
slab covering them in an inclined position. This impost
measures sixteen feet in <span class="sc">l</span>ength and ten broad, and is at
a medium about fourteen inches thick. It rests on five
of the uprights only; and at its other end is perforated
by a small circular hole. No tradition exists as to the
<!--233.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pageno">195</span>
time of its erection; but its name at once designates it
being a work of the Britons, and sepulchral; the term
Trevedi (Trevethi) signifying, in the British language,
the place of the Graves.”</p>

<p>King Doniert is said to have been the father of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ursula, rendered famous by her unfortunate expedition
from Cornwall to the coast of Flanders, but still more
famous by the beautiful picture of her embarkation,
painted by Claude de Lorraine, where the Saint, accompanied
by her eleven thousand virgins, are descending
to their ships in a port, decorated with buildings the
most superb, and surrounded by a distant landscape,
imagined and arranged in the highest style of that celebrated
master.</p>

<p>Those ladies, although an exaggeration from eleven
to eleven thousand is suspected by some writers, were to
have married a Roman emperor and his principal officers;
but being attacked on their landing by Pagan
Saxons, they defended themselves with a courage worthy
of Cornwall, until all were slain with arms in their
hands. Yet one hardly sees why these heroic females
were honoured among the saints. Their deaths as martyrs
are referred to the 20th of October 383, and their
tomb is still shown at Cologne, where a monastery has
been built to their memory.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Not far from King Doniert’s stone monument is another
perpendicular moor-stone, on which is still apparent
the figure of a cross; and on another, not far distant, is
a cross shaped like a T.</p>

<p>Without doubt I think this our King Doniert lived
and died in his town and castle of Leskeard, where it
was not lawful to bury the bodies of dead men till the
year 700. It is moreover to be noted, with regard to the
inscription on his monument of stone, that about this
time it was customary to pray for departed souls.</p>

<p><!--234.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pageno">196</span>
Not very distant from the said monument, in the open
downs, are to be seen a great number of moor-stones,
some artificially squared, and placed in a perpendicular
manner about three feet high. These are commonly
called the Hurlers: a Druidical monument having
been changed, by the fraud and artifice of the priests,
into a supposed monument of God’s vengeance against
persons for not attending on their masses.</p>

<p>About a mile north of the church the granite hills
make their appearance, and run across the parish in a
curved line. The only variety which this rock presents
are coarse and fine grained masses, and a kind of fluor,
near Carraton Hill, containing hornblende. Immediately
south of the granite, on the side of a barren moor, masses
of compact and quartz ore felspar rock protrude, indicating
the same formation as at Trewist in Alternun.
Near the church hornblende slate prevails, which is said
to contain veins of actynolite and asbestos. A little
further south, on the ridge of a barren down, massive
hornblende rock projects in tiers; and loose blocks of the
same stone lie scattered over the side of the hill, and in
the adjacent valley.</p>

<p>The whole of the southern part of the parish is composed
of varieties of this same rock, several of which are
well displayed in the vicinity of Rosecradock.</p>

 Probably this place took its name not from a gate painted red being there
placed, as is generally imagined, but from its being situated just above Fowey
river; Rhie-gat signifies River’s course. The Fowey river at this place is not
above half a mile from the source of Looe river.</p>

 The following account of these stones is copied from Mr. Polwhele’s
Cornwall, <abbr title="volume two, page">vol. ii. p.</abbr> 195.</p>

<p class="footnote">“In the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clere, about 200 paces to the eastward of Redgate, are
two monumental stones which seem parts of two different crosses. They have
no such relation to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they ever contributed
to form one monument. One is inscribed; the other, without an inscription,
called ‘the other half stone,’ seems to have been the shaft of a cross,
and originally stood upright, but has latterly been thrown down, from an idle
curiosity to ascertain whether any concealed treasures were beneath its base. On
one of its sides are some ornamental asterisks, but no letters of any kind. Its
present length is about eight feet; yet it seems to have been once longer, as the
upper part is broken, and displays part of a mortice. The inscribed stone, nearly
square, appears to have been a plinth of a monumental cross, having the words
‘Doniert rogavit pro anima’ inscribed upon it, in similar characters to those
used about the ninth century. Doniert is supposed to mean Dungerth, who was
king of Cornwall, and accidentally drowned about the year 872. Of the meaning
and intention of this monument, see Borlase, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 361, 362.”</p>

 I take some credit to myself for this conjecture as to the original meaning
of “the other half stone.” And I have, long since writing this, accidentally
discovered what strongly confirms my opinion. The authors of the Beauties of
England and Wales, speaking of inscribed stones at Ebchester, in Durham, say,
there is one having the single word “Have” for Ave on it. This stone is supposed
by Horsley to be sepulchral. Have Melitina Sanctissima. The custom
of thus saluting, as it were, the dead, or taking their last farewell of them, is
very well known, and it may seem almost needless to produce any instances of
it. Thus Æneas bids eternal adieu to Pallas:</p>

<div class="fn poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="i4 small">Salve æternum mihi, maxime Palla,</div>
  <div class="i2 small">Æternumque vale.&mdash;Æneid, <abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr> 97.</div>

<p class="footnote unindent">Thus also a passage in Catullus,&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave atque vale.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_29" id="footnote_29"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_29"><span class="muchsmaller">[29]</span></a>
  <span class="sc">Druid, Druides, or Druidæ.</span>&mdash;Some derive this word from the Hebrew
Derussim, or Drussim; which they translate Contemplatores. Pliny, Salmasius,
Vignierius, and others, derive the name from δρυς, an oak, on account of
their inhabiting, or at least frequenting and teaching in forests, or because they
sacrificed under the oak. Menage derives the word from the old British “Drus,”
which signifies “Dæmon” or “Magician;” Borel, from the old British “Dru”
or “Deru;” whence he takes δρυς to be derived. Goropius Becanus, <abbr title="liber one">lib. i.</abbr> takes
“Druis” to be an old Celtic or German word, formed from “trowis” or “truis,”
signifying a “Doctor of the Truth and Faith.” Father Peyron, in his book of
the Original of the Celtic Language, will have both Greek and Latin to come
from Celtic; and if so, the Greek word δρυς must come from the Celtic “deru.”
The groves where they worshipped were called Llwyn; thence, probably, is derived
the word “Llan,” signifying now, in Welch, a church. These groves
were inclosures of spreading oak, ever surrounding their sacred places; and in
these words, “1st. Gorseddan,” or Hillocks, where they sat, and from whence
they pronounced their decrees, and delivered their orations to the people;
“2nd. Carnedde,” or Heaps of Stones, on which they had a peculiar mode of
worship; “3rd. Cromlech,” or Altars, on which they performed the solemnities
of sacrifice.</p>

<p class="footnote">There were several orders of them:&mdash;1st. Druids; the chief of these was a
sort of Pontifex Maximus, or High Priest; these had the care and direction of
matters respecting religion; 2nd. Bards; who were an inferior order to the
Druids, and whose business it was to celebrate the praises of their heroes, in
songs composed and sung to their harps; 3rd. Eubates; who applied themselves
chiefly to the study of Philosophy, and the contemplation of the wonderful
works of Nature.</p>

<p class="footnote">There were Women as well as Men Druids; for it was a female Druid who
foretold to Dioclesian, when a private soldier, that he would be Emperor of
Rome. They taught physics, or natural philosophy; were versed in astronomy
and the computation of time; were skilled in arithmetic and mechanics;
and appear to have been the grand source from whence the ages in which
they lived derived all the knowledge which they possessed.</p>

<p class="footnote">Among the numerous places sacred to Druidical worship many hieroglyphical
characters have been discovered, which doubtless were intended for something
relative to their opinions of the Deity to whom they paid their adoration. But,
in addition to this, they taught their pupils a number of verses, which were only
a sort of memorials or annals in use amongst them. Some persons remained
twenty years under their instruction, which they did not deem it lawful to commit
to writing. They used indeed the Greek alphabet, but not the language, as
appears by a note, <abbr title="chapter thirteen, liber Six">chap. xiii. lib. VI.</abbr> of Cæsar’s Commentaries de Bell. Gall.
This custom, according to Julius Cæsar, seems to have been adopted for two
reasons: first, not to expose their doctrines to the common people; and, secondly,
lest their scholars, trusting to letters, should be less anxious to remember
their precepts, because such assistance commonly diminishes application and
weakens the memory.</p>

<p class="footnote">The original manner of writing amongst the ancient Britons was by cutting
the letters with a knife upon sticks, which were commonly squared, and sometimes
formed with three sides. Their religious ceremonies were but few, and
similar to those of the ancient Hebrews. The unity of the Supreme Being was
the foundation of their religion; and Origen, in his Commentaries of Ezekiel,
inquiring into the reasons of the rapid progress of Christianity in Britain, says,
“this island has long been predisposed to it by the doctrine of the Druids,
which had ever taught the unity of God the Creator.” (<cite>Extracted from the
Monthly Magazine and Literary Panorama for November 1819.</cite>)</p>

history in short is thus: He was born at Rome, of an
old family of gentlemen or noblemen, in the reign of
Tiberius; whose father’s name was Emelianus, a Christian,
that placed his son Clete a disciple under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter;
after which he made him and Linnus coadjutors in
the ministry. To Linnus <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter gave the charge of

who in justice should have had it,) till the time that
Domitian, the son of Vespasian, enjoyed the empire,
who, degenerating from the morality of his father and
brother Titus, raised the second persecution against the
Christians; at which time, amongst many others, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

divided the City of Rome into twenty-five districts or
parishes, and to have set up a priest to rule and govern
in spiritual matters over such Christians as were within
the same, and attended their predicaments; whose successors
afterwards in those churches were called cardinals.</p>

<p>Bas-ill, in this parish, or Bas-yll, in former ages (at
best being but a poor corn country) has been for many
ages the seat of the worshipful family of the Trevillians
[Trevelyan]; the present possessor, Peter Trevillian,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married Borlace, his father Arundell.</p>

<p>His ancestor was John Trevillian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Nettlecomb
in Somerset, who was sheriff of Somerset and Dorset
17 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>; his grandson John Trevillian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was
sheriff of Cornwall 38 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> The arms of
which gentlemen are in a field Gules, a demy horse
Argent, issuing out of the waves of the sea Azure,
grounded upon a tradition that one of their ancestors,
at the supposed general inundation or concussion into
the sea, of a tract of land called Lyon-ness, extending
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Sennan to the Scilly Islands, saved himself
by sitting on the back of a white horse, whilst he swam
from thence through the sea to the insular continent of
<!--237.png--><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
Cornwall, where he came safe to land; but when I consider
that Solinus, who lived 1500 years past, tells us
that the Cassiterides, by which he means the Scilly
Islands (or the tin islands), in his days were separated
from the coast of the Danmonii, by a rough sea of two
or three hours’ sail (as it still appears to be), and that
hereditary coat armours and surnames in Britain are
little above five hundred years old in Britain or Cornwall,
there is small credit to be given to this tradition.</p>

<p>In this parish, or part of Davidstowe, is Foye-fenton,
the original fountain of the Foys River; which well, in old
records, is also called West Fenton, i. e. the west well, to
distinguish it from Mark well in Lanick, otherwise east
well; from which places the two cantreds (hundreds)
of Eastwellshire and Westwellshire are denominated.
And to this purpose it is evident, from Carew’s Survey
of Cornwall, page 41, that in 3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Reginald de
Ferrar held in East Fenton and West Fenton, several
knights’ fees of land of the honour of Tremeton, which
is now East and West Hundreds. (See also <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s
by Saltash, of those tenures in 1360.)</p>

<p>In this parish stands Basil, a word sometimes taken
for a herb or vegetable, sometimes for a vein in the
human body, sometimes for the basilisk or cockatrice,
<abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; but here I take it to signify after the Greek, a
basilica or stately building; and although at present this
mansion will not answer the etymology in the extreme
latitude or longitude thereof, yet in probability it formerly
did, at least comparatively so in respect to other
houses in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This place is the mansion of the ancient, famous, and
knightly family of Trevillyans; the present possessor of
Basil is Peter Trevillyan, who married a daughter of
Mr. Nicholas Borlase of Treludderin. From this Cornish
<!--238.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>
family are descended the Trevillyans of Nettlecomb
in Somersetshire.</p>

<p>Although this parish is commonly called and written
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleather, yet the right name is <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eledred, and so
it is written in the Taxatio Beneficiorum; which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Eledred I take to be Ethelred King of the Mercians,
who, after he had held the crown for thirty years, and
governed with great reputation, and especially with
much regard to religion, which (as William of Malmesbury
observes) was more to this prince’s inclination than
arms, resigned the kingdom to his kinsman Kendred,
became a monk, and died soon after in the monastery
of Bordeney in Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>There was, however, another <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ethelred, King of the
West Saxons, who is said by Mr. Browne Willis, in his
Notitia Parliamentaria, to be buried at Wimborne
Minster in Dorsetshire, with the following inscription:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hoc loco quiescit corpus Sancti Ethelredi Regis West-Saxonum martyris,
qui A.D. 872, 23 die Aprilis, per manus Danorum Paganorum occubuit.</p>

<p>Perhaps this latter is the true patron.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Bishop Tanner, in the Notitia Monastica, says of
Bordeney Abbey,</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Here was a public monastery before the year 697,
to which Ethelred King of Mercia was a great benefactor,
if not the original founder; who upon the resignation
of his crown retired hither, and became first a
monk, and afterwards abbat of this house till his death.
It is said to have had three hundred monks, but was destroyed
by the Danes A.D. 870.”</p>

<p>The branch or stock of the Trevelyans settled at
Basil is now extinct. A Sir John Trevelyan, Knight,
of that place, is said to have greatly reduced his fortunes
by various law-suits. An anecdote is anciently
related of him in the neighbourhood, that having failed
<!--239.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
in making an appearance to some civil suit, a process
issued to the sheriff for attaching his person, who went
to Basil accompanied by several horsemen, and riding
into the court-yard made proclamation of his authority,
and called on the defendant to surrender; but he, on the
contrary, threatened the sheriff if he did not depart, with
letting loose his spearmen upon him, and then overturned
some hives of bees, which effectually routed the
whole troop.</p>

<p>Basil now belongs to the family of Mr. Robert Fanshawe,
an Out Commissioner of the Navy Board resident
at Plymouth, who made the purchase from Mr.
Tremayne of Sydenham.</p>

natural circumstances of the place. And I doubt not
that before the Norman Conquest this church or chapel

<p>In this church town is the well-known place of Conor,
Condura, id est, the King or Prince’s Water (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Cornwall),
whose royalty is still over the same, and whose
lands cover comparatively the whole parish; from which
place in all probability was denominated Cundor or
Condor, in Latin Condorus, i. e. Condura, Earl of Cornwall
at the time of the Norman Conquest, who perhaps
lived, or was born here. And moreover, the inhabitants
of this church town and its neighbourhood will tell you,
by tradition from age to age, that here once dwelt a great
lord and lady called Condura.</p>

<p>This Condurus, as our historians tell us, in <a name="Condurus" id="Condurus"></a>1016 submitted
<!--241.png--><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
to the Conqueror’s jurisdiction, paid homage for
his earldom, and made an oath of his fealty to him;
but this report doth not look like a true one, for most
certain it is, in the 3rd year of the Conqueror’s reign, he
was deprived of his earldom, the same being given to the
Conqueror’s half-brother, Robert Earl of Morton in
Normandy, whose son William for a long time succeeded
him in that dignity after his death. Is it not, therefore,
more probable that this Earl Condurus confederated with
his countrymen at Exeter, in that insurrection of the
people against the Conqueror in the 3rd year of his
reign, and for that reason was deprived of his earldom?
Be it as it was, certain it is he married and had issue
Cad-dock (id est, bear or carry-war), his son and heir,
whom some authors call Condor the Second, who is by
them taken for and celebrated as Earl of Cornwall.</p>

<p>But what part of the lands or estate thereof he enjoyed
(whilst Robert and William, Earls of Morton aforesaid,
his contemporaries, for thirty years were alive, and
doubtless possessed thereof, as well as his title and dignity)
hath not yet appeared to me. His chief dwelling
and place of residence was at Jutsworth, near Saltash
and Trematon, where he married and had issue one only
daughter named Agnes, as some say, others Beatrix,
who was married to Reginald Fitz-Harry, base son of
King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, by his concubine Anne Corbett, in whose
right he was made Earl of Cornwall, after William Earl
of Cornwall aforesaid had forfeited the same, by attainder
of treason against the Conqueror and his sons, and
was deprived thereof.</p>

<p>This Earl Caddock, or Condor the 2nd, departed this
life 1120, and lies buried in the chancel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s

<p>Pen-are, alias Pen-ar, in this parish, parcel of the
Duchy manor of Moris aforesaid, was heretofore the
dwelling of my kind friend James Lance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a Commissioner
of the Peace and Surveyor of the Duchy of
Lancaster during the Interregnum, or usurpation of
Cromwell. He married &mdash;&mdash; Blackston of London.</p>

<p>This gentleman sold this barton to Hugh Boscawen,
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>
of Tregothnan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who settled it in marriage with his
daughter Bridget, on Hugh Fortescue, of Filley, in Devon,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now in possession thereof.</p>

<p>Since writing the above, Mr. Fortescue departed with
those lands to Grenvill Hals, of Truro, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>, who dying
without issue, and his unthrift elder brother, James Hals
of Merthyr succeeding as his heir to those lands, he
hath sold the same to one Mr. Cregoe, for about twelve
hundred pounds.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_32" id="fnanchor_32"></a><a href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Tre-simple, in this parish, was the lands of I have forgot
whom, who sold it to Henry Vincent, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law,
descended, as Mr. Foote informed me, from the
Vincents of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen, who married Kendall of Pelyn;
his father, Lampen; and gave for his arms, in a field
three cinquefoils.</p>

<p>By Kendall he had issue Walter Vincent, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> barrister-at-law,
who married &mdash;&mdash; Nosworthy, and a daughter
named Jane, married to Harris, of Park; after by his
second wife, daughter of Richard Lance, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> he had
issue Peter Vincent, to whom he gave this Tresimple,
who sold it to his brother Walter Vincent aforesaid, and
Shadrack Vincent; Edward Vincent, killed by a fall
from his horse 1700; and Mary, married to Joseph Halsey,
clerk, some time rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael, Penkwell.</p>

<p>Park, in this parish (id est, a field, or a park for beasts),
is the dwelling of Covin, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr></p>

<p>Pol-wheele, or Polwhele, in this parish (id est, the head
or top), is situate at the top of a hill; from whence was
denominated an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed
Polwhele, who gave for their arms as underneath: in a
field Sable, a saltire engrailed Ermine; and from that
<!--244.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pageno">206</span>
time discontinued the arms of Trewoolla (<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> three owls),
the Cornish motto of which Polwhele’s arms was, Karenza
whelas Karenza, id est, Love or affection seeks, searches,
begets, or works love. The present possessor, John Polwhele,
<abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> barrister-at-law, who married Redinge, of
Northamptonshire, his father Baskewill of Dorset, his
grandfather one of the daughters of Judge Glanvill in
Devon, his great-great-grandfather one of the coheirs
of Ten-Creek of Treworgan, which place afterwards he
made his dwelling.</p>

<p>Lastly, let the reader observe, that if the true name of
this church be <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, then its tutelar guardian
and patron, to whom it was dedicated, was <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement,
Pope and martyr of Rome; whose name is derived from
Clemens, mild, meek, merciful, gracious. He was born
in the region of Calimontana in Italy; his father’s name
Faustine. He was contemporary with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, and was
his coadjutor or assistant in preaching the Gospel, as is
testified by himself in his epistle to Timothy, wherein he
saith, “Help those persons that labour with me in the
Gospel, whose names are written in the Book of Life.”
He appointed that in the seven regions of Rome should
be the notaries, to write the deeds and martyrdoms of the
Christians, and commanded that such as were baptized
and had learnt the principles of the Christian religion,
should receive the sacrament of confirmation, and as
some write, he made the Canon of the Apostles and the
Apostolic Constitutions now extant. Finally, for preaching
the Gospel of Christ in derogation of the Roman
religion, he was by command of the Emperor Trajan,
with a rope about his neck, and an anchor fastened
thereto, cast into the main sea and drowned, uttering
those last words, “Eternal Father, receive my soul!”
after he had been Pope of Rome nine years, two months,
and ten days, the 23rd of November Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 102.
He gave orders twice in December, and ordered fifteen
bishops, ten priests, and twenty-one deacons, as Baronius
saith.</p>

<p>The Polwheles of this place are of great antiquity. They
flourished before the Conquest, at which time they were
so eminent that Drew de Polwhele was chamberlain to
the Conqueror’s queen; and the late John Polwhele,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> had not long since in his possession, a grant from
her to the said Drew of several lands in this county,
which deed he having sent to a gentleman to peruse,
he could never get it back again. From the time of this
Drew or Drogo de Polwhele, the family have lived with
much esteem in this their habitation, till the latter part
of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, when Degory Polwhele, on
his marriage with Catherine the eldest daughter and coheir
of Robert Trencreek, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> removed to her seat of
Treworgan in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme, where the family resided till the
sale of that place to Mr. Collins, when they returned to
their old dwelling.</p>

<p>The present possessor, Richard Polwhele, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was
sheriff of Cornwall 9 George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1723.</p>

<p>The family suffered greatly in the civil wars.</p>

<p>Penhellick was once a considerable seat, although
now it is divided into several premises, in one of which
lately resided Mr. Robert Polwhele, younger brother to
John Polwhele, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and in another Captain Thomas
Gregor, of Truro.</p>

<p>Trewhythenick formerly belonged to a family of the
same name, who gave for their arms, Argent, a chevron
within a border engrailed Sable. This manor came
afterwards to the Chamonds.</p>

<p>Park also belonged to a family of the same name.</p>

<p>Lambesso belonged to the Tredenhams, but for some
time past to the Footes.</p>

<p>Polwhele has descended from the gentleman who
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pageno">208</span>
served the office of sheriff in 1723, to his grandson, the
<abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Polwhele, author of a history of Cornwall,
and so distinguished by his works in every department
of literature; by his early poetical effusions,
when</p>

<p class="center small">“He lisp’d in numbers for the numbers came;”</p>

<p class="unindent">by those of his maturer age; by sermons equally sound
in learning and in diction, and persuasive by their eloquence;
that no Cornishman of the present day can
presume to place himself, I will not say in competition,
but in the same class of literary excellence with Mr.
Polwhele.</p>

<p>At Penhellick, about seventy years ago, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
John Collins, rector of Redruth, built a house for his
own residence after removing to the village; he is reported
to have selected this spot in consequence of
several persons residing in it having attained great ages.
On his decease, the house and lands were sold to a
Colonel Macarmicke, originally a wine merchant at
Truro, who much enlarged the house, and endeavoured
to affix some fanciful new name on the place. The
property has since passed through various hands, and
the house has generally been unoccupied.</p>

 Admiral Carthew Reynolds built a good house here in the latter part of the
last century. He was considered to be an excellent officer and a skilful seaman;
yet he lost his life when a ninety-gun ship, under his command, was first injured
by some other vessel, and then driven on the flat sands near the entrance of the
Baltic in the winter 1811-12.</p>

<p>It is so called from the barton of Little Colon or Golon,
contiguous with the church, on part of which
ground perhaps the same was founded, and endowed
with part of the lands thereof. At the time of the Norman
Conquest this district passed in tax under the
names of Carneton, or Ryalton; and the church being
built and endowed by Walter Brounscomb, Bishop of
Exeter, 1250, it was by him appropriated to the canons
Augustine of his college of Glasnith, by him founded.

<p>From this barton of Colon was denominated an old
family of gentlemen, from thence surnamed De Colon;
of which family Roger de Colon was seised of a knight’s
fee of land 25th Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, which he held by the
tenure of knight-service. Carew’s Survey Corn. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 52.

was married to John Blewet, a younger branch of the

Blewets of Holcomb Rogus in Devon, who afterwards
was made sheriff of Cornwall the 26th Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> (when
Richard Yeard, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was sheriff of Devon); which
Jane’s estate was no small advance of the wealth of his
house, from whom all the Blewets of Cornwall are since
descended, some of whom have erected a monument in
this church in memory of those De Colons; and several
of them have made Colon a font name in their family
to this day, of which I may not in justice forget
my late kind friend Major Colon Blewet, a valiant commander
under King Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> against the Parliament
army, who married Elizabeth daughter of Sir William
Wrey, Knight, but died without issue; whose brother
Robert, that married Arundell, a base son, succeeded
to this his estate, who had issue another Robert
that married Wood, as I remember, and sold the moiety
of this barton of Colon to Robert Hoblyn, of Nanswiddon,
clerk, rector of <a name="err17" id="err17"></a>Ludgnan, now in possession
thereof; the arms of Blewet were, Or, a chevron between
three eagles Vert. The Hampshire Blewets, as
Camden saith, gave Or, an eagle displayed with two
necks and heads Gules.</p>

<p>Coswarth, also Cosowarth, synonymous words, the
far off, or remote wood, which place, as Mr. Carew
tells us, at the time of the Norman Conquest, transnominated
the French family or name of Escudifer, i. e.
shield-bearer or Esquire, to that of Coswarth; in which
place those gentlemen flourished in great wealth and
tranquillity, till John Cosowarth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> lord of this place,
tempore Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> having issue, by Williams, one
only daughter named Katherine, married first to Allen
Hill, and afterwards to Arundell of Trerice, suffered the
greatest part of his lands and estate to go with his
daughter’s children, and then entailed this manor and
barton of Coswarth on the heirs male of his family, by
virtue of which settlement his uncle, John Cosowarth,
succeeded to those lands, who had issue by Sir William
<!--249.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
Lock’s daughter, Thomas Cosowarth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married
Seyntaubyn, sheriff of Cornwall 26th Elizabeth, who by
her had issue John and Dorothy; and Dorothy was
married to Kendall. After the death of John, Edward
Cosowarth his uncle succeeded to this inheritance of
Cosowarth, and married Arundell of Trerice, who had
issue by her Samuel Cosowarth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards
knighted by Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> He married Heale of Fleet, and
had issue Edward, Samuel, and John, that died before
their father; Robert and Nicholas succeeded to this
estate successively, but died both without issue. The
which Robert, upon some distasteful words given him
by his cousin John Coswarth, one of the heirs male in
remainder, did by fine and proclamation bar the estate
tail, and made it fee simple in himself and his heirs.
So that after his decease his brother Nicholas succeeded
to the estate, who by an accidental fall from his horse
(coming home from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, as was reported, somewhat
intoxicated with liquor), instantly died, without
issue; after whose decease <a name="Colan" id="Colan"></a>Bridget Cosowarth, his only
sister, daughter of Sir Samuel aforesaid, succeeded to his
inheritance, who married Henry Minors of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedor,
her cousin-german, by whom she had issue one only
daughter named Anne, who was married to Captain
Francis Vivian of Truan, by whom he had issue one
only daughter named Mary, since become wife and lady
of Sir Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> now in
possession of Coswarth and Vivian’s estates.</p>

<p>The arms of Cosowarth are, Argent, on a chevron
between three falcons’ wings Azure, five Bezants.</p>

<p>This place I suppose is that manor of land in the
Domesday roll taxed by the name of Chor, also Chore,
and now vulgarly called Cud-chore, or Cud-jore, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
the wood-play, interlude, show, or diversion; pageants,
sights, pastimes, to delight the people. Now choariou
in Cornish, hoariou in the Armorican tongue, is as
ludi in Latin, and ludo and ludus. And further memorable
<!--250.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
it is that Sir Samuel Coswarth of this place frequently
styled himself Sir Samuel Cudjore for Cudchoariou,
for such was the name of the place before the
woods about were destroyed. Then it assumed the name
of Cosowarth, i. e. the further-off wood, when the woods
on the south-west part of it were destroyed.</p>

parts, and that her life was written in the Cornish
tongue, and in possession of one Mr. Roscarrock, though
now there is no such person or book extant that I can
hear of. Only, let it be remembered that I found it
written in the Sieur D. T.’s French book of the Saints,
as also in Surrius’ and Bosquet’s books, and Baronius
(out of them), that there lived at Senns, in Gallia, now
France, in the time of the fifth persecution by the emperor
Aurelian, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 276, a holy Christian Virgin
named Colomba, of such exquisite beauty that one of
his sons fell passionately in love with her; but because
he could not obtain his lustful desire of her, offered
her marriage, but he being an idolater she refused his
embraces. Whereupon she was much persecuted by
Aurelian and cast into prison; where she suffered much
hardship, and was comparatively starved to death in that
place; so that in great misery she expired there, and
was buryed at Senns. At whose grave many supernatural
facts, or miracles, being said to be done, she
obtained the reputation of a saint and martyr, anno
<abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 300.</p>

<p>The feast of the dedication of this church is in November,
near Sancta Colomba Virginis et Martyris day;
and the fair depends upon it.</p>

<p>As for the south aile of this church before-mentioned,
it was called Jesus Chapel, and therein was founded Trinity
chantry; towards building or endowment whereof
the Lords of Resurrans tied these lands for ever to pay
to the same 13<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> 4<span class="value"><abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></span>

At the dissolution of this chantry 1 Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> John
Chaplin was chief chanter, or sole priest thereof, and
seised of the said rent, as his predecessors had been long
before; and King Edward being so possessed, by virtue of
an Act of Parliament, sold the same, with other things,
to Sir Hugh Pomeroy, Knight, and Thos. Pomeroy,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> his brother; who the 4th Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> sold it to
<!--253.png--><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
William Saplyn; and &mdash;&mdash; Saplyn, in the 1st and 2nd of
Philip and Mary, sold it to John Glyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, John Ganergan,
William Prye, John Manifield, Richard Carter,
Henry Rouse, John Vivian, and Richard Hancanon,
who were trustees for the parish of Sancta Colomba.
After which conveyances the Lord of Resurrans refused
to pay the said rent. Whereupon the parish distrained
those lands, and the owner thereof replevined the goods
so taken, which occasioned the parish bringing an action
in replevin against the replevers thereof; and for plea,
by way of avowry, did allege that those goods they
ought to take, for that one John chaplain of Trinity
chantry was seised of the said rent in fee, as his predecessors
time out of mind had been before, in right of
the said chantry, from which it passed to King Edward the
Sixth, and the purchasers under him as aforesaid.
Whereupon the issue passed for the plaintiff, or parish,
against the Lord of Resurrans. (See <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael Penkivell,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Wike; also for Chantry, see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert
for prayer for the dead.)</p>

<p>In the year 1676, the greatest part of this church of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb was casually blown up with gunpowder by
three youths of the town, scholars therein, who, in the
absence of their master and the rest of their companions,
ignorantly set fire to a barrel of gunpowder, the parish
stores, laid up in the stone stairs and walls of the rood-loft,
which occasioned the destruction of it and themselves
together; for the glass-window, roofs, timber, stones,
and pillars, thereby made a direful concussion together,
especially those shot from the walls of the moorstone
stairs aforesaid, to the total defacing the church and
many pews thereof.</p>

<p>In this tragical concussion several accidents were
strange and unaccountable. As, first, that one Nicholas
Jane, a hellyar, was on a ladder mending the healing,
or stones on the roof of the church, when it happened,
whereby he himself and the ladder under him
<!--254.png--><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
were blown up also; but both fell to the ground without
hurt. Secondly, the church bible and common-prayer
book, with their leaves open, in the rector’s pew, scarce
two feet from the rood-loft stairs, where the powder took
fire and broke out, were neither singed, moved, nor
so much as any dust about them, though many thousand
stones were cast about the church. Thirdly, there
was at least a ton weight of lime and stone cast upon
the communion table, which was old and slight, having
but one foot or pedestal to stand upon, and yet the same
was not broken nor hurt. Fourthly, the pulpit was in
like manner preserved from the fury and rage of the fire
and stones, when the very walls and pillars near it were
shattered to pieces. Let divines and philosophers give
a reason for these things, if there was not a supernatural
cause or Providence for it!</p>

<p>By this sad accident this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb received
damage to the value of about 350<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; yet was, by
the liberal contributions of its inhabitants, in nine
months time built and repaired as it now stands, and
what was wanting in subscriptions to make up that sum,
was raised by a small parish rate on the lands thereof.
The chief subscribers, Sir John Saint Aubyn, of Trekininge,
Baronet, 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; his grandmother-in-law, the
widow of Peter Jenkin, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>;
John Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of
Truan, 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; his three sons, Thomas, John, and Francis
Vivian, 15<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; Robert Hoblyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
10<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; Edward, his
son, 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; Captain Ralph Keate,

volume 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; John Day, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
5<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; Peter Day, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
5<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>; Honour Carter, widow,

20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>, with several others.</p>

<p>And, as if the fiery element had a particular power
over this church, it is further memorable that several
times before a stone pinnacle of the tower thereof was
cast down with thunder and lightning, and had as often
been built up again to no purpose, till at length the
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pageno">217</span>
workmen were advised, upon their last operation, to inscribe
in the stone thereof, “God bless and preserve
this work;” since which time it hath stood invincible for
about sixty years. But, alas! notwithstanding this
pinnacle hath been thus exempted from the raging of the
fiery element, yet its next neighbour, the lofty spire or
steeple on the said tower, a strong and well-built structure,
bound or cramped together with iron and cast lead
through the moor-stones thereof, (so that, comparatively,
according to man’s judgment, it might last till
the final consummation of all things,) yet so it happened
on a Thursday in July 1690, that about one of the
clock in the afternoon, when the people were at their
traffic in the market place contiguous with the churchyard,
the said spire or steeple was torn and shattered to
pieces with a flash of lightning, and totally thrown to
the ground, and the iron bars therein wreathed and
wrested asunder as threads, to the great terror and astonishment
of the beholders. It was further observable
when this concussion happened, only divers flashes of
lightning appeared, but no sound or crack of thunder
was heard; from whence I infer that when the voice of
thunder is heard, the fiery matter in the middle region,
perhaps not three miles above our heads, hath spent its
force and strength. This spire also was soon after re-edified
by the inhabitants of this parish, though much
short of its former height and bigness, as it now stands.</p>

<p>Again, contiguous with this church-yard was formerly
extant a college of Black Monks or Canons Augustine,
consisting of three fellows, for instructing youth in the
liberal arts and sciences; which college, when or by
whom erected and endowed I know not. However, I
take it to be one of those three colleges in this province
named in Speed and Dugdale’s Monasticon, whose revenues
they do not express, (nor the places where they
were extant,) but tell us that they were dedicated to the
<!--256.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pageno">218</span>
blessed Virgin Mary, the lady of angels, and were black
monks of the Augustines.</p>

<p>In this college, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>, was bred up John
Arundell, a younger son of Renfry Arundell, of Lanherne,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> sheriff of Cornwall 3 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> where he
had the first taste of the liberal arts and sciences, and
was afterwards placed at Exon College in Oxford, where
he stayed till he took his degree of Master of Arts, and
then was presented by his father to John Booth, Bishop
of Exeter, to be consecrated priest, and to have collation,
institution, and induct, into his rectory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb.
Which being accordingly performed, and he resided
upon this rectory glebe lands for some time, which gave
him opportunity to build the old parsonage house still
extant thereon, and moat the same round with rivers
and fish-ponds, as Sir John Arundell, Knight, informed
me afterwards. In the year 1496, he had by Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
bestowed upon him the bishopric of Lichfield and
Coventry, then void upon the translation of William
Smith to Lincoln, (the successor of John Hals,) in which
see he remained till the year 1501, and then, upon the
death or translation of Richard Redman, Bishop of
Exeter, he was removed to that diocese by Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
then possessed of great revenues, but died at London,
1504, and was buried at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s Danes Church.</p>

<p>Before this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb was erected, within
the borders of its now parish were extant four free chapels,
wherein God was worshipped in former ages, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
at Tregoos (i. e. the wood towne), Tre-sithan-y (the
weekly town, the town frequented on the Sabbath);
Ruth-es (i. e. the multitude is); and Lan-hengye (i. e.
the church or temple of sentence, judgment, or deliberating
cases). The old cemeteries of which are now all
converted to orchards and gardens, or arable ground.</p>

<p>The town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, by the mediation of its lords,
the Arundells of Lanherne, is privileged with a weekly
market on Thursdays, wherein all things necessary for
<!--257.png--><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
the life of man are vended at a moderate rate; as also
with fairs on Thursday after Midlent Sunday, and on
Thursday after Allhallows.</p>

<p>This place was heretofore for a long time notorious
for the vice of excessive topling or toping, not only to
the damage of many of the inhabitants’ healths and
wealth, but also to the loss of too many lives; I mean
in the time of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> when the practice of quaffing,
toasting, or healthing, debauch and immorality, overspread
the land in general.</p>

<p>In this parish stands Castell-an-Dinas. It consists of
about six acres of ground, within three circles or intrenchments,
upon the top of a pyramidal hill, composed
or built of turf and unwrought stones, after the British
manner, without lime or mortar, comparatively a hedge;
each of those circles or ramparts rising about eight foot
above each other towards the centre of the castle, consisting
of about an acre and a half of land, in the midst
whereof appear the ruins of some old dilapidated houses;
near which is a flat vallum, pit, or tank, wherein rain or
cloud-water, that falls down from the middle regions,
abides more or less in quantity as it falls one half of the
year; which, I suppose, heretofore supplied the soldiers’
occasions, as no fountain, spring, or river water is
within a thousand paces thereof. There were two gates
or portals leading to this fort, the one on the east, the
other on the west side thereof, which, on a stony
causeway now covered with grass, conducts you up and
down the hill towards Tre-kyning, that is to say the
king’s, prince, or ruler’s town. Moreover, contiguous
with this castle are tenements of land or fields, named
Tre-saddarne, that is to say god Saturn’s town, a place
where the god Saturn was worshipped by the soldiers,
who probably had their temple or chapel here before
Christianity.</p>

<p>Near this castle, by the highway, stands the Coyt, a
stony tumulus so called, of which sort there are many
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
in Wales and Wiltshire, as is mentioned in the Additions
to Camden’s Britannia in those places, commonly called
the Devil’s Coyts. It consists of four long stones of great
bigness, perpendicularly pitched in the earth contiguous
with each other, leaving only a small vacancy downwards,
but meeting together at the top; over all which
is laid a flat stone of prodigious bulk and magnitude,
bending towards the east in way of adoration, (as Mr.
Lhuyd concludes of all those Coyts elsewhere,) as the
person therein under it interred did, when in the land
of the living; but how, or by what art this prodigious
flat stone should be placed on the top of the others,
amazeth the wisest mathematicians, engineers, or architects,
to tell or conjecture. Colt, in Belgic-British, is a
cave, vault, or cott-house, of which coyt might possibly
be a corruption.</p>

<p>Not far from this coyt, at the edge of the Goss-moor,
there is a large stone, wherein is deeply imprinted a
mark, as if it were the impress of four horseshoes, and
to this day called King Arthur’s Stone; yea, tradition
tells us they were made by King Arthur’s horse’s feet,
when he resided at Castle Denis, and hunted in the Goss
Moor. But this stone is now overturned by some seekers
for money.</p>

<p>On another part of this parish, near Retallock Barrow
(that is to say, Retallock Grave), is a notable tumulus,
wherein some human creature of that place was
interred before the 16th century. Retalloch signifies
exceeding or too much buckler or target, not far from
which is still extant, in the open downs, nine perpendicular
stones, called the Nine Maids, in Cornish Naw-voz,
alias the nine sisters, in Cornish Naw-whoors, which very
name informs us that they were sepulchral stones, erected
in memory either of nine natural or spiritual sisters of
some religious house, and not so many maids turned
into stones for dancing on the Sabbath Day, as the
country people will tell you. Those stones are set in
<!--259.png--><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
order by a line, as is such another monument also called
the Nine Maids in Gwendron, by the highway, about
twety-five feet distance from each other; or it is rather
in Stithian’s parish.</p>

<p>Truan, Truin, Truyn, Trevan, Trewyn, are all synonymous
words, signifying a nose, nook, or beak of any
matter or thing; here to be construed as a nose, nook,
or beak of land, extant or notable amongst others; which
place and Trenouth, for four descents, hath been the
dwelling of the gentle family of the Vivians, who have
flourished here in worshipful degree.</p>

<p>The present possessor of this place is my very kind
friend John Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall about 20
Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and one of His Majesty’s Justices of the
Peace, a gentleman famous for his hospitality and charity.
He married three wives; the first, Jane, daughter
of Sir John Trelawny, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>, but had no issue by her
that lived; his second was Mary, daughter of John
Glanvill, of Killyvor, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, in Devon, by whom he had
issue Thomas, John, Francis, Anne, and Jane; his last
wife was Specott, the relict of &mdash;&mdash; Nicholls, by whom he
had no issue. His father married two wives, &mdash;&mdash; Buller
and &mdash;&mdash; Cavall; his grandfather married &mdash;&mdash; Lure; his
great-grandfather one of Tresaster’s heirs, as I am informed.</p>

<p>Thomas Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, eldest son of the aforesaid John,
married &mdash;&mdash; Blathwayte, sister to William Blathwayte,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Secretary at War to King James the Second and
William the Third, but had no issue by her. His second
wife was the daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Dodson, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> but died without
issue by her. His second brother, John Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
barrister-at-law, married also two wives: the first Anne,
daughter of Matthew Hals, of Efford, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, but she also
died without issue; on whose death her father-in-law
made this epitaph fixed on her hearse, 1682:</p>

<p>His second wife was Mary, daughter of Joseph Sawle,
of Penrice, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he hath issue John, Mary,

<p>Francis Vivian, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> third son of the aforesaid John,

heir to her mother Bridget, the only surviving child of
Sir Samuel Coswarth, Knight (see <a href="#Colan">Colan</a>), by whom he

<p>In the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, for three or four descents,
lived the gentle family of the Carters (originally descended
from the Carters of Staffordshire), where by trade
and merchandise they got a great estate, and married
with Vivian, Arundell of <a name="err18" id="err18"></a>Solverne, and Moyle of Bake;
and lastly, Richard Carter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, a Justice of the Peace,
and Member of Parliament for Mitchell, married Elizabeth
King, alias Lucas, alias Shepard, of the City of London,
spinster, a woman destitute of fame and fortune,
whereby he was led into such excess of riot and expence
of monies that he was forced to sell all his lands, and
<!--261.png--><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pageno">223</span>
reduced himself to about 50<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum during life.
Part of his lands were sold to his younger brother, John
Carter, who married &mdash;&mdash; Lawry, whose three daughters

Risdon, of Badleigh, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, and Thomas Hoblyn, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr>

<p>Trevethick, in this parish, alias Trevidick, i. e. the rustic
or farmer’s town, for several descents had been the
dwelling of the gentle family of the Arundells, a younger
branch of Lanherne stock, particularly Thomas Arundell,
who married the daughter of Sir Giles Montpesson,
Knight, by whom he had issue Thomas Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>

<p>Nans-widdon, Nanc-widd-an, i. e. the valley of trees,

chapel or cemetery extant before the Norman Conquest),
formerly the voke lands of a man taxed in Domesday
Roll, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, for four or five descents was
the seat of the genteel family of Keates, and was till
lately in the possession of my very kind friend Capt.

<p>Gauer-y-gan, in this parish, id est, the goat’s downs,
gave name and original to the genteel family of the
Gauerigans, who for several generations lived here in
good reputation, till the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s

reign, at which time the last two daughters and heirs of
this family were married to Godolphin and Trefusis,
whose heirs are now in possession of their estate. Which
family gave for their arms, in allusion to their names,
in a field Vert, a goat passant Argent, as I am informed;
the form of which is still extant in their pew or seat, the
foremost in one of the middle rows of seats in this
church.</p>

<p>At Tre-sugg-an (id est, the town on the Saggor Bog),

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin has here copied Hals with very little alteration,
except by way of abridgment.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals has a very long dissertation on the claims
of another person, a male <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb, to be accounted
patron saint of this parish.</p>

<p>It is well known that Cornwall received the Christian
<!--264.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
faith from various individuals who came from Munster,
in Ireland, where the learning and the religion of these
times certainly flourished: all those persons were held in
veneration by their converts, and were distinguished by
them as saints. These missionaries were, moreover, so
numerous in all parts that Ireland was called the Land
of Saints. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb may possibly be one of those
missionaries; but the subject is of little importance, and
I am unwilling to bestow the elegant appellation of the
Holy Dove, on any other than a female saint.</p>

<p>Nanswhyden, unquestionably the White Vale, is
mentioned by Mr. Hals as belonging to the Hoblyns.
Mr. Robert Hoblyn, of Nanswhyden, who died in 1756,
was a very distinguished person. He was generally a
man of letters; but, what is rarely to be found in a country
gentleman, he excelled in the recondite learning of
the East. He built a magnificent house at Manswhyden,
and established there a library so extensive, and so rich
in manuscripts, as to be valued at thirty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>This gentleman received a great addition to his fortune
from a most productive copper mine, called Herland,
or the <a name="err19" id="err19"></a>Mane Mine, in the parish of Gwineat, and
he married a daughter of Mr. Coster, an Alderman of
Bristol, at that period the most extensive smelter of copper
ores. In consequence of this connection, and his
deserved reputation, Mr. Hoblyn was chosen one of the
representatives of Bristol.</p>

<p>The house was entirely consumed by an accidental
fire in 1803. The property has descended to his collateral
relation, the Reverend Robert Hoblyn, who inherits
also a large portion of his classic taste.</p>

is situated on one of the highest
hills in the hundred of Penwith, commanding an extensive
view over the western extremity of Cornwall, from
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives to the Land’s End. Borlase gives the following
description of its remains: “Castle-An-Dinas consisted
of two stone walls, one within the other in a circular form,
surrounding the area of the hill. The ruins are now
fallen on each side the walls, and show the work to have
been of great height and thickness. There was also a
third, or outer wall, built more than halfway round.
Within the walls are many little inclosures of a circular
form, about seven yards diameter, with little walls round
them of two or three feet high, they appear to have been
so many huts for the shelter of the garrison. The diameter
of the whole fort from east to west is four hundred
feet, and the principal ditch sixty feet. Towards
the south, the sides of the hill are marked by two large
green paths, about ten feet wide. Near the middle of the
area is a well, almost choked up with its own ruins, and
at a little distance a narrow pit, its sides walled round,
probably for water also, now filled up.”</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Borlase did not publish a plan
to illustrate his description of this Castle, as it has been
much dilapidated since his time. A tower was built on
the site of the outer wall about forty years ago, by Mr.
Rogers, of Penrose; and subsequent reparations have
not contributed towards a restotation of the old walls.
Nor are there any perceptible remains of the inclosures.</p>

<p>This parish measures 12,045 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>A small portion of the southern part of this parish,
adjoining to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis, rests on granite, the surface of
which abounds in projecting masses of shorl rock. Leaving
this granite district about the Indian Queens, on
the Great Truro Road, a tin mine, called the Fat
Work, presents itself, and displays some interesting phenomena.
The basis of the rock is a compact felspar,
sometimes almost colourless, at other times dark blue
and glossy; but more commonly both these kinds are
blended together in stripes or spots like agates. This
rock next the lode is much decomposed, the blue parts
being changed into a light pink; which shows that the
colouring mineral is not hornblend. It is probably
shorl, a substance abounding in the quartz veins by
which the rock is traversed. The lode of this mine is
very curious. It consists of a large massive rock, fifteen
fathoms in width, throughout which shorl, and irregular
veins of tin ore, are dispersed. The matrix consists of a
dark-coloured basis, interspersed by innumerable angular
and fragment-like portions of rock.</p>

<p>Near the Indian Queens a manganese mine was formerly
worked, and the adjacent moors abound in stream
works.</p>

<p>A fine blue fissile slate occurs around the town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Colomb, and continues for some distance northwards.
Near Trewan it is found to contain beds of compact
rocks (not unlike those of the Mount Bay), which inclose
veins of actynolite. Still proceeding northward,
quartz so much prevails, as to occasion sterility in the
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
land, displayed in open downs like those of Roach, to
which they adjoin.<!--267.png--><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span></p>

Castle-An-Dinas is composed of a siliceous variety of
the rock found at Fat Work mine; and it appears to be
one of the sources from whence must have been derived
the pebbles and striped shorl rock scattered over Tregoss
Moor.</p>

impropriated, or appropriated to the prior of Bodmin
before the Inquisitions of the Bishops of Lincoln and
Winchester, 1294, or Wolsey’s afterwards, is not named
therein; the prior by ancient composition paying the vicar
or curate here only six pounds per annum; by which
bargain he was a great gainer, at least 250<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum,
and I take it the present patron and impropriator, Mr.
Buller, paya the curate not above 25<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum. This
parish was rated to the 4<span class="value"><abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr></span> per pound Land Tax, 1696,

<p>This church, according to its bigness, is the finest,
best-kept, pewed, or seated, that I know of in Cornwall;
the rood-loft, (yet standing, though without a rood on
it,) a most curious and costly piece of workmanship,
carved and painted with gold, silver, vermillion and
bice, is the masterpiece of art in those parts of that
kind. The pews or seats are uniform, all made of blackt
oak; and to prove their antiquity, there is yet extant an
inscription on one of them, containing these words:
<!--269.png--><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>
“These seats were built by the poor’s stock in the year
1525.”</p>

<p>At Tre-loye in this parish (the flowing or abounding
town) is still extant a famous chapel, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Pedyr, perhaps of public use before this church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Colomb was erected.</p>

<p>This district in Domesday Roll passed under the name
and jurisdiction of the great lordship and manor of Ryalton,
heretofore pertaining to the prior of Bodmin,
which lands are held of the Bishop of Exeter’s manor of
Penryn, and pay yearly 10<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> high rent to the same;
from whence I gather that formerly both pertained to
the bishopric of Cornwall, afterwards converted into
Kirton and Exeter; and that afterwards, by compact between
the said bishop and prior of Bodmin, it was dismembered
from that bishopric, and restored to that
priory, as parcel of the ancient bishop of Bodmin’s revenues,
of which that priory consisted, and was endowed
with at its first foundation by the bequests of the
ancient earls of Cornwall.</p>

<p>For the name of Rial-ton or Ryal-ton (if it consists of
those particles), it signifies the royal, kingly, or princely
town, as pertaining heretofore to the king of England or
earls of Cornwall; and suitable to this etymology it
claimeth the jurisdiction and royalty over the whole
hundred of Pider. So that whosoever is now farmer
thereof, is by custom its head bailiff, as the prior of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Pedyr at Bodmin was; from whose font-name the same
is still denominated Pider (id est, Peter, as formerly said),
the which farmer or bailiff is steward of the Court Baron
of the said hundred or decima, and also of the Court
Leet held within the jurisdiction or precincts of the
manor aforesaid, and his substitutes constantly attend
the service of both. To remove an action-at-law depending
in the Court Leet of this manor, the writ must
thus be directed: Senescallo et Ballivo manerii nostri
de Rialton in comitatu de Cornubiæ salutem. To remove
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
an action out of hundred court, whereof as I said
the farmer of this manor is lord, the writ must be thus
directed: “Senescallo et Ballivo hundredi et libertatis
de Peder, in comitatu Cornubiæ, salutem.”</p>

<p>When the priory of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peder at Bodmin was dissolved,
26 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> and those lands vested in the
crown, one John Mundy, barrister-at-law, (son of John
Mundy, sheriff of London 6 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> afterwards Sir
John Mundy, Knight, Lord Mayor of London 14
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>) was sent down from London to be seneschal
or steward of this manor of Ryalton and hundred
of Pider. In which capacity he demeaned himself so
well, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Elizabeth, that when the set-off of the last
prior for ninety-nine years expired, and Mr. Mundy’s
son succeeded in the same office as his father, was in
this place, at such time as James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by statute prohibited
the granting of church lands at lease for longer than
twenty-one years under the old rent, Mr. Mundy took a
lease thereof from the Crown for that term, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> of 60<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>
per annum, and his posterity renewing or retaking the
same as those leases expired, thereby this estate, worth
about 1000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, continued in this family till some
time after the restoration of Charles the Second, when Sir
Francis Godolphin, Knight, by favour of that King,
took a reversion or new set thereof, before Mr. Mundy’s
expired, on condition of doubling the rent from 60<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> to
120<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, so that Sir William Godolphin, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr>
is now in possession thereof; and the Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Sidney
Lord Godolphin was created Baron Godolphin of
Ryalton, 33 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> whereby this family of Mundy
are comparatively undone, notwithstanding they were
stout Cavaliers and opposers of Cromwell and the Parliament
army to their utmost power and strength. Well
therefore doth the royal Psalmist advise all men not to
put their trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in
whom is no help.</p>

<p>The arms of Mundy are, in a field, three lozenges, on
a chief three eagle’s legs erased.</p>

<p><!--271.png--><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pageno">233</span>
The mansion-house at Ryalton wherein Mr. Mundy
dwelt, was much beautified and augmented by prior
Thomas Vivian, to which belongs a strong prison and
dungeon for putting debtors in durance. Query, whether
this barton of Ryalton payeth tithes to the impropriator?
All priories, monasteries, religious houses, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
above the yearly value of 200<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, being exempted
from it by the statute 31 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> chiefly
because the same were given for and applied to charitable
uses and the maintenance of the poor; and verily,
if the name Ryalton be compounded of those syllables
ry-all-ton, it signifies give or bestow all town, or a town
that gave or bestowed all its revenues to the poor, and
pious uses. And that the reader may know in what
manner poor men were sent to such religious houses to
be fed and maintained during life, as penitentiaries or
otherwise, by their superiors, or such as had power to
visit the same, I will set down an instance or example,
out of Fox’s Acts and Monuments, page 53, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> contained in a letter from John Langland,
Bishop of Lincoln, 1524, to the Abbot of Ensham, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
“My loving brother, I recommend me hearty unto you,
and whereas I have according to law sent this bearer
T. R. to perpetual penance within your monastery of
Ensham, there to live as a penitent and not otherwise;
I pray you nevertheless, and according to the law command
you, to receive him, and see you order him there
according to his injunctions, which he will show you if
you require the same. As for his lodging, he will bring
it with him, and his meat and drink he must have as you
give of your alms; and if he can so order himself by his
labour within your house in your business, whereby he
may deserve meat and drink, so may you order him as
you see convenient to his deserts, so that he pass not
the precinct of your monastery. And thus, fare you
heartily well. From my place, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>” This injunction
of penance was, 1. To fast every Friday during life,
taking no other sustenance than bread and ale after it;
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pageno">234</span>
and every even of Corpus Christi’s day to fast during
life, and after fasting to take no other sustenance than
bread and water that day, unless prevented by sickness;
also in part to say our lady’s Psalter every Sunday
during life; he is marked in the cheek, as other penetentiaries,
with the letter P. (See Egleshayle and Penuans
in Creed.)</p>

<p>At Towan in this parish, is that well-known place

inhabitants disposed to adventure therein.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Rialton is the object of highest importance in this
parish. Its antiquities are not much known; but when
Mr. Sidney Godolphin was created Earl of Godolphin,
his son, who had married Henrietta Churchill, eldest
daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, assumed the
appellation of Lord Rialton, and Lady Rialton was one
of the ladies of the bedchamber to Queen Anne.</p>

<p>A small print is given of the south entrance gate still

<p>The property belonged to the late Mr. Thomas Rawlings
of Padstow, having probably been acquired when
lands were sold by the duchy to redeem the land-tax,
but it was alienated on his decease.</p>

<p>New Quay, mentioned by Mr. Hals as a pretty safe
road and anchorage for vessels, and also as a convenient
place for establishing a fishery, is become a successful
station for sea nets. In Lord Dunstanville’s edition of Carew,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 357, it is stated, “The place was called New Quay,
because in former times the neighbours attempted to
supply the defects of nature by art, in making there a
quay for the road of shipping, which conceit they still
retain, although want of means in themselves or in the
plan have left the effect in nubibus. The quay has
now been many years constructed, but I apprehend it is
not capable of receiving any other than small vessels.”</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>On the eastern side adjoining to the Downs, the rocks
are quartzose, but the greater part of this parish is composed
of slates belonging to the calcareous series, which
extend to the sea shore. At Tremper Bridge, and in the
islands lying at the entrances of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb Porth, beds
of black limestone occur, associated with talc, schist, and
blue slates.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature, however, of this parish
<!--274.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pageno">236</span>
is the testaceous sandstone at New Quay, and on the
shores of Fistral Bay. The land adjacent to the sea at
those places is covered with sand, which above high-water
mark is lapidified, as is also a bed of pebbles on
which the sand sometimes rests. For the particulars of
this phenomenon the first and the fourth volumes of the
Cornwall Geological Transactions may be consulted.</p>

Christianity. He was the son of Constantius Chlorus
Emperor of Rome; first an officer of war under the Emperor
Aurelian, against Coill or Coillus, King or Duke
of Colchester in Britain, (called by some writers Caer-Collyn,
Caer-Col-lyn, i. e. the city or castle on the neck
of the lake, or bosom of waters, it being situate on the
confluence of the Medway river), which Coil, having
refused to pay the tribute due to the Senate of Rome,
caused that province to revolt; but Constantius forced
him into a submission, when soon after he died; and
Constantius is said to have married his only daughter
and heir Helen, by whom he had all her father’s lands
and territories, Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 289.  By her he had issue
Constantine, who followed the wars in his father’s time
against Maxentius; and lying on his bed, before a battle,
a dream or vision appeared to him in shape of an
angel, holding in his hand a shining red cross, and calling
to him with a loud voice “Constantine! Εν τουτῳ νικα,

cross to be pourtrayed in all his banners, called the labanum,
and soon after gave battle to Maxentius at Pont
Milvium, in Italy, where his [the latter’s] army was
routed, and himself drowned in that river. The success
of which battle so wrought upon Constantine that he
forthwith turned Christian, and was baptized by Pope
Silvester, Bishop of Rome.</p>

late at night, and both much intoxicated with liquor, (as
himself told me,) nevertheless having so much sense left
as to consider that they were to pass through several tin
mines or shafts near the highway, on the south-east side
of Redruth town, alighted both from their horses, and
led them in their hands after them. The servant went
somewhat before his master, the better to keep the right
road in those places, which occasioned Mr. Chapman’s
turning aside somewhat out of the way, whereby in the
dark he suddenly fell into a tin mine above twenty fathom
deep, at whose fall into this precipice his horse
started back and escaped; in this pit or hole Mr. Chapman
fell directly down fifteen fathoms without let or
intermission, where meeting a cross drift (above six
fathom of water under it), he in his campaign coat,
sword, and boots, was miraculously stopped, where
coming to himself, he was not much sensible of any
hurt or bruises he had received, through the terror and
horror of his fall; when, considering in what condition
he was, he resolved to make the best expedient he could
to prevent his falling further down, (where, by the dropping
or reesing of stones and earth moved by his fall,
he understood there was much water under,) so he
rested his back against one side of the mine, and his
feet against the other, athwart the hole, and in order to
fix his hands on some solid thing, drew his sword out of
its sheath and thrust the blade thereof as far as he could
into the opposite part of the shaft, and so in great pain
and terror rested himself.</p>

<p>The suddenness of this accident, and the horse’s escaping
in the dark as aforesaid, was the reason why Mr.
Chapman’s servant, who went before him, did not so
soon find him wanting as otherwise he might, which as
<!--277.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pageno">239</span>
soon as he did, he went back the road way in quest of
him, calling him aloud by his name; but receiving no
answer, nor being able to find the horse, he concluded
his master had rode home to his house some other way,
whereupon, giving up all further search after him, he
hastened home to Constantine, expecting to have met
him there; but, contrary to his expectations, found he
was not returned. Whereupon his servants, early next
morning, went forth to inquire after him, and suspecting
(as it happened) he might be fallen into some tin-shafts
about Redruth, hastened thither, where, before they
arrived, some tinners had taken into custody his horse
(with bridle and saddle on) which they found grazing
on the Wastrell Downs. Whereupon, consulting together
about this tragical mishap, it was resolved forthwith
that some of those tinners, for reward, should search
the most dangerous shafts in order to find his body either
living or dead; accordingly they employed themselves
that day till about four o’clock in the afternoon without
any discovery of him. Finally, one person returned
to his company, and told them that at a considerable
distance he heard a kind of human voice under ground;
to which place they repaired, and making loud cries to
the hole of the shaft, he forthwith answered them that
he was there alive, and prayed their assistance in order
to deliver him from that tremendous place; whereupon,
immediately they set on tackle-ropes and windlass on
the old shaft, so that a tinner descended to the place
where he rested, and having candle-light with him
bound him fast in a rope, and so drew him safely to
land, where, to their great admiration and joy, it appeared
he had neither broke any bone, or was much
bruised by the fall; verifying together the attribute of
Divine Omnipotence that nothing is impossible with
God,&mdash;and that old English proverb, that drunkards seldom
take hurt; for, as the tinners said, if he had fallen
but two or three feet lower, he must inevitably have
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pageno">240</span>
been drowned in the water. But maugre all those adverse
accidents, after about seventeen hours stay in the
pit aforesaid, he miraculously escaped death and lived
many years after, and would recount this history with as
much pleasure as men do the ballads of Chevy Chase or
Rosamond Clifford.</p>

<p>In this parish is the dwelling of James Trefusis, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
that married Worth; his father Penarth, originally
descended from Trefusis of Trefusis in Mylor, as I am
informed.</p>

<p>Moreover, it must be remembered in this place, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Constantine, that he was the first prince that ever endowed
Christian churches beyond the seas with standing
rents, lands, and revenues, and also gave to the
church the tenth part of all lands and goods he possessed
himself, whereupon the clergy claimed tithes therein by
a law. And such officers or publicans as gathered it
were called Decumani, (as Appian saith); for before
that time tithes were only taken by the Senate of Rome
and Emperor for the supply of the legions and armies in
time of war, and not otherwise. Afterwards, Constantine
made a law that all princes under his dominion
should give the tenth part of their revenues towards the
maintenance of churches and temples, as himself had
done.</p>

<p>From this law and example Ethelwulf, the second
sole Saxon monarch in England, Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 838, in the
year 855 (as Ingulphus, Abbat of Croyland, in his history
of Britain, 1066, informs us), by royal charter confirmed
the tithes of all his lands on the church in those
words: “Decimam partem terræ meæ,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and this was
done (gratuito consensu) by consent of his princes and
prelates. This donation afterwards was confirmed by
King Ethelred. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Nemo auferat à Deo quod ad Deum
pertinet, et præcessores nostri concesserunt,”</span> <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Afterward
King Athelstan made a law, Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 926, that
every man should pay tithes out of all the goods he
<!--279.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pageno">241</span>
possessed, as Jacob did; which Edmund Ironside confirmed
under penalty of being accursed, 1016. Afterwards
King Edward the Confessor, 1046, ordained more
expressly that all tithes should be justly paid to the elder
or mother churches, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> de garba, grege equarum, pullis,
vaccis, vitulis, caseo, lacte, vellis, porcellis, apibus,
bosco, prato, aquis, molendinis, parcis, vivariis, piscariis,
virgultis, hortis, negotionibus, et omnibus rebus, quas
dederit Dominus, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; which decree or statute was afterwards
ratified by William the Conqueror and his successors.

<p>Tonkin adds nothing to Mr. Hals in respect to this
parish except the following short account of the manor
of Merthyr or Merther. Mr. Tonkin cites from Carew,
(<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 128 of Lord Dunstanville’s edition,) “Rogerus de
Carminou ten. 20 part. feo. milit. extra 10 part. illius
20 in Wynnenton, Merthyr, et Tameron.” This Sir
Roger de Carminow, for he was a knight, left this manor
inter alia to his eldest son and heir Sir Thomas Carminow,
of Carminow, Knight, who, leaving only three
daughters his heirs, this manor fell to the share of Philippa,
the wife of John Treworthen.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Merther is now the property of Sir Richard Vyvyan,
and has been for a considerable time in his family.</p>

<p>The family of Trewren of Trewardreva, is now I believe
extinct; the name is usually pronounced Trew-ren, and
certainly has not the etymology which Mr. Hals imputes
to it.</p>

<p>Carwithenick in this parish was the seat of Mr. Chapman,
preserved almost by a miracle according to Mr.

Francis Gregor first married the eldest daughter of Mr.

appears to be the prevailing rock of this small parish.

<p>Tre-ganell, or Tre-gonell, in this parish, that is to say,

<p>Tre-ago, also Tre-agho, synonymous words, in this

of this little barton and manor, and from thence denominated;
tri-ago is in Latin-Cornish a threefold action,
or acting or making; tre-ago, the town of action. From
this place was also denominated its lord, of an ancient
family of gentlemen surnamed De Tre-ago, who at his
own proper cost and charge built the south aile in the
now vicarage church of Crantock, and appropriated the
same to his family or heirs and assigns for ever, by
charging those lands with the repair and maintenance
thereof (for ever) as at this day they do, without being

after the death of his father or grandfather, sold this
place and most of his other lands to Hugh Boscawen of
Tregothnan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now in possession thereof,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>

<p>This place was heretofore privileged with the jurisdiction
of a court leet, and a strong prison for keeping
prisoners for debt in durance, though now I take it to
be destitute of both. The arms of Mynors were, Sable,
an eagle displayed Or, on a chief Azure, bordered Argent,
a chevron between two crescents above and a rose
beneath Or. This last bearing on the chief, and marshalled
within the escutcheon was, as tradition saith,
the coat armour of Treago; and such sort of marshalling
divers coats Nicholas Upton doth approve of, especially
where a man hath large possessions by his mother, and
but a small patrimony from his father; as perhaps the
case was thus with Mynors.</p>

<p>In this parish is the port, haven, or creek, called the
gonell or ganell, that is to say the canal or channel of
the Tremporth river, leading into the sea, wherein much
fish and fowl is caught; and many times ships frequent
this place for trade and safety, the sea here winding up
itself between the lands about a mile in the country. It
also, at full sea, affordeth entrance and anchorage for
ships of the greatest burthen, if conducted by a pilot
that understands the course of the ganell or channel;
at the head of which, as a ligament fastening the parishes
of Lower <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb and Crantock together, is a
county bridge, called Trem-porth; that is to say, the
tying, fastening, terrifying, or making afraid gate, cove,
or entrance, so aptly named perhaps from the rapid confluence
of this channel or river in winter season, before
the bridge was built, where it meets the salt waters, and
the softness of the clay and sea-moore marsh there on
which the bridge is situate.</p>

<p>I find William Smith, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Crantock in Cornwall,
<!--288.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pageno">250</span>
(which I take to be of this place,) was created a baronet
by Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, 27 December 1642, patent 418. I suppose
the son of that Smith of Exon, that married one of
the coheirs of Vyell of Trevorder. He had issue Sir
James Smith, Baronet, (but where they lived in this
parish I know not,) whose arms were, Sable, a fess and
two barrulets, between three martlets, Or.</p>

<p>The manors of Cargoll and Ryalton being given by
our earls of Cornwall before the Norman Conquest to
the Bishop of Bodmin or Cornwall, or the prior thereof;
some of them were founders and endowers of this college
of Crantock out of the lands and revenues thereof.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>I take the tutelar saint of this parish to be <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kerantakers,
a disciple of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Columb in the Hebrides;
and the parish no doubt had its name from him.</p>

<p>This parish is wholly impropriated to John Butler,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Morval, who allows out of it a small stipend
to the incumbent (at present Mr. Warn), by which, together
with the parishioners’ benevolence, he makes a
hard shift to live.</p>

<p>The collegiate church here was, as tradition saith,
endowed by the prior of Bodmin; but by which prior is

<!--291.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pageno">253</span>
taxed under the name of Tybesta, of which more under.
At the Inquisition of the Bishops of Lincoln and Winchester,
in order to the Pope’s Annats, 1294, Ecclesia

<p>The great duchy manor of Ty-besta encloses almost
the whole of this parish; and there are yet extant in
this manor the ruins of an old chapel, called by the name
of Tybesta. This manor is privileged with the jurisdiction
of a court leet within its precincts, and of the
court baron held for the hundred of Powdre, and hath
stewards and bailiffs to attend the service of both, and
the royalties over the river Vale.</p>

<p>Within this lordship is situate the borough of Grampont,
Gram-pond, or Gran-pont, that is, great bridge;
on which Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, saith
that in his time, (about a hundred years past,) if that
were its true name, it had nothing then extant but
nomine sine re, though now it hath a fair stone bridge
over it, built and repaired by the county stock. But,
alas! notwithstanding those names, it appeared from
the charter lately extant, wherein the ancient rights and
privileges thereof are confirmed by Edmund Plantagenet
Earl of Cornwall, son of Richard, King of the Romans,
Anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1290, that it was incorporated by the name
of Coyt-fala, or Coit-fala; id est, the wood, (river) in
the midst of which wood heretofore the same was situate;
also Pons-mur, id est, great bridge, so named from some
eminent timber bridge over the river, before that of stone
was erected.</p>

<p>It is privileged with the jurisdiction of a court
leet and quarterly sessions of the peace, within the
same, before the mayor, recorder, and eight aldermen,
or magistrates, and a town-clerk. The mayor to be
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pageno">254</span>
chosen out of the eight Magistrates that are free-men;
and also with sending two Members, to sit as their
Representatives in Parliament, who are to be chosen by
the Mayor, Magistrates, and Freemen, or the major part
of them; by election of which, if common fame be true,
the townsmen have in the last ages reaped great gain
and advantage. It is also appurtenanced with public
fairs, upon January 18 and June 11, and a weekly
market on Thursdays. The chief inhabitants of this
town are Mr. Teague, Mr. Harvey, Mr. Moor.</p>

<p>The arms of this Borough are, a castle, two ports
open, over the same a lion rampant crowned, within a
bordure bezanty, which latter charge was the proper
arms of King Richard Cœur de Lion, uncle of the said
Edmund Earl of Cornwall, and his predecessors Caddock
and Condur, Earles thereof.</p>

<p>Tre-veleck, alias Tre-belech, in this parish, id est, the
Priest’s Town, in old British and the Armorican tongue,
was of old the seat of the De Boscawens, of Boscawen
Rose in Buryan, of which family was Lawrence Boscawen,
<abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law, that married Tregothnan’s
heir, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Henry 8th, who left this place to his
younger son; where his posterity flourished in genteel
degree down to the latter end of the reign of King
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; when the last gentleman of this house, that
married Tanner, had issue only two daughters, married to
Brewar and Tousen, which latter’s daughter and heir was
married to Collins, now in possession of those duchy lands.</p>

<p>At Ten-Creek, or Tene-Cruck, i. e. the fire-bank, or
tumulus, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the sepulchre of one interred there before
the sixth century, whose body was burnt to ashes by
fire, according to the then accustomed manner of intering
the dead, and his bones and ashes laid up in an
urn or earthen pot, in a bank, or barrow, or tumulus,
upon some part of the lands of this barton; from which
facts it was called Ten-creek, in which place for many
ages flourished a family of gentlemen, from thence denominated
de Tencreek (which compound word Mr.
<!--293.png--><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a><span class="pageno">255</span>
Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, by conjecture interprets
as the town of the burrow, bank, or tumulus); the
last gentleman of which house died in the middle of
Queen Elizabeth’s reign, leaving issue only three daughters,
married to Mohun, Penwarne, and Polwhele.
Those lands came to Mohun, a younger brother to
Reginald Mohun, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> father of John Lord Baron
Mohun, of Oakhampton. The present possessioner,
William Mohun, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (my very kind friend), one of his
Majesty’s Commissioners for the Peace and Taxes, that
married Jane, daughter of Sir John Trelawney, of the
Lawne, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> and hath issue Warwick Mohun, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
whose arms are, Or, a cross engrailed Sable. [See
<a href="#Boconnoc"><span class="sc">Boconnoc</span></a>]. The arms of Tencreek were, Argent, a
cross pattée surmounted of a chevron Sable.</p>

<p>Pennans, part of the Duchy manor of Tybesta, is
compounded of Pen-nans, the head of the valley, a
name taken from the natural circumstances of the
place. It is the dwelling of Philip Hawkins, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
attorney-at-law, who by his great pains, care, and skill
in that profession, hath got himself a very great estate
in those parts. He married Scobell, and giveth for
his arms, Argent, on a saltire Sable, five fleur-de-lis Or.
The same coat armour is given by the Hawkins’ of
Kent. He had issue John, his eldest son, who married
Rashleigh, and was a doctor of divinity; Philip, that
married Ludlow, of London, Member of Parliament for
Grampound; and daughters.</p>

<p>Nan-tell-an, in this parish Duchy, was the dwelling
of John Vincent, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney-at-law, who got a considerable
estate by the law; but since his death I take
it this place, and all other his lands, are wasted by his
son, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Nantellan sold to Henry Vincent, of Treleven,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Mr. Vincent married Evans, and giveth for his
arms as mentioned under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen, the original tribe
thereof.</p>

<p>Car-lyn-ike, in this parish, parcel of the Duchy
<!--294.png--><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
manor of Tybesta aforesaid, probably the rock and
lake of water, is the dwelling of John Woolrige, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
that married Maunder, and giveth for his arms, Gules, a
chevron Argent, between three wild ducks volant Proper.
The descendant of Woolridge, rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael Penkivell, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>Nan-car (Duchy) i. e. the Valley Rock, or the Rock
in the Valley, is the dwelling of Walter Quarme, Clerk,
that married Grace Gayer, daughter of Samuel Gayer,
of Araler, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>; his father Ceely, his grandfather a
Trefusis, and giveth for his arms, Barry lozengy Argent
and Gules.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Trencreek is interpreted by Mr. Carew the town of the
Burrow, by which I apprehend he means a dwelling near
some creeig, byrig or tumulus; for that is the import
of the word Trencreeig, from whence an old family of
gentlemen, now extinct, were denominated, who gave for
their arms, Argent, a cross patee, surmounted with a
chevron Sable. But the tumulus importing their name
must have been erected since the doctrine of Christianity
was brought into this land; for before that time graves
were called beths,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_35" id="fnanchor_35"></a><a href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></span>
veths, or byrigs, from whence our modern
words burrow or bury. The Brigantes mentioned
by Tacitus were so denominated from their lofty tumuli,
byrigs, or graves.</p>

<p>All the lands in this parish are either held from or in
parts of the Great Duchy.</p>

<p>The Borough of Grandpont. This is the name given
to it by the Normans, for the ancient Cornish name was
Ponsmur, signifying the same thing. In all likelihood
this is the ancient Voluba of the Romans mentioned by
Ptolemy; so called from its situation on the river Val or
<!--295.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pageno">257</span>
Fal. Browne Willis, in his additions to Camden, cites a
charter still extant from John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall,
by which all former privileges are confirmed to the
vill of Grampont, with all the lands of Coytpale, which
signifies Tolewood, and a part of the town is at this
time called Caitfala. This charter is dated at Chippenham
<abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 26, 1332.</p>

<p>North of Grampond lies Trevellick, the town on the
mill stream or water, where is a ruined chapel and a
well, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Naunton or Nonnio, as at Alternum.
The estate now belongs to Degary Polkinhorne,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> To the North of this lies Nantellan, which was
the seat of John Vincent, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> an eminent attorney.</p>

<p>Trewinnow, that is the dwelling on the marshes, has
been long held under the Duchy by the family of Seccomb.</p>

<p>Pennance, the head of the valley, is held under the
tenure of customary Duchy, and was formerly the seat
of Henry Hoddy, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> descended from the Huddys or
Hodys, of Nethoway, in Devonshire. He had a considerable
estate in these parts, which he foolishly lavished
and at last sold to Mr. Thomas Lower, younger brother
to the famous Doctor Lower,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_36" id="fnanchor_36"></a><a href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></span>
who did not keep it long,
but conveyed his right in it to Philip Hawkins, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
since become the most wealthy attorney which this
county ever produced. He married Mary, the daughter
of Richard Scobell, of Menagwins, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and left the bulk
of his estate, computed at one hundred thousand pounds,
to his eldest son John Hawkins, D. D. Master of Pembroke
College, Cambridge, who married Rachel Rashleigh,
of Menabilly, but died sine prole. Doctor Hawkins
laid out very large sums of money on the improvement
of Pennance. He died in London July 30, 1736.</p>

Trigantan belongs to the family of Sperrack.</p>

<p>The Church is situated at one end of the parish near
the river Val or Fal, in a fruitful spot of land, but low.
It is but a mean structure, consisting of a nave, a south
aile of the same length, and a cross north aile. Here
was formerly but a poor small tower covered with wood,
in which were three bells; but the parishioners took that
down in 1732, and have in this year (1733) finished a
handsome square tower. The Rectory House has also
been new built in a neat manner by the present incumbent
Mr. Hughes.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The manor of Tybesta, carrying with it the advowson
of the rectory, was purchased from the Duchy by the
late Sir Christopher Hawkins.</p>

<p>Grampound is the only place ever wholly deprived of its
privilege to return Members to the House of Commons,
previously to the general dissolution of Boroughs in
1832. Cricklade, Shoreham, and Aylesbury, had been
thrown into adjacent hundreds, that is, the freeholders
of these districts were admitted to a concurrent right of
voting with those previously possessing it; but from
Grampound the Members were transferred at once to the
County of York.</p>

<p>The passage referred to in Mr. Carew (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 328 of Lord
Dunstanville’s edition) is this:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Grampond, if it took that name from any great bridge,
hath now nomen sine re; for the bridge there is supported
with only a few arches, and the Corporation but
half replenished with inhabitants, who may better vaunt
of their town’s antiquity than the town of their ability.”</p>

<p>The town is said to have very greatly improved, in all
respects, moral, physical, and intellectual, since the minds
of its inhabitants have been directed to other objects
than low intrigue and servile dependence on the exertions
of others.</p>

Pennance, was the son of Mr. Henry Hawkins, whose

<p>The Creed given by Mr. Hals, in his account of this
parish, differs materially from both subjoined to my
edition of “The Creation of the World, and Noah’s
Flood,” one of which is said to be in old Cornish, and
the other in modern. All the three go to prove how
utterly vague and uncertain must be a language not
fixed by some general reference to works of authority,
nor guided by the superior influence of a Capital.</p>

<p>Clowens, in this parish, id est, White Cloos, those
sort of grey marble stones so called, whereof an innumerable
strag of them are visible upon a great part of
the lands of this barton above ground, particularly in
the Deer Park. Mr. Carew tell us, that Clowens is derived
from the Greek κλω, cloow, to hearken. But glewas
in Cornish is to hear, and golsowins, to hearken. This
place for many ages hath been the seat of the genteel
and knightly family of the Seyntaubyns, now Baronets,
whose first ancestor came out of Normandy, a soldier,
with William the Conqueror, 1066, who first settled
himself at &mdash;&mdash;, in the county of Devon; and in process
of time Guy Seyntaubyn (afterwards knighted),
Sheriff of Cornwall 22 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> as I take it, first
<!--300.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pageno">262</span>
settled himself in this place, and married Alice, one of
the daughters and coheirs of Sir Richard Sergreaulx,
Knight, Sheriff of Cornwall 12 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> (who died at
Killigarth, or Colquite), by whom he had issue. But
after Sir Guy’s death, his lady Alice having her lands all
in her own dispose, married Richard de Vere, Knight of
the Garter, and the 11th Earl of Oxford of that house;
by whom he had issue John the twelfth Earl of Oxford;
and Sir Robert Vere, Knight, that married Margaret,
the daughter of Sir Hugh Courtenay, of Haccomb,
Knight, heir to her mother Philippa, one of the coheirs
of Sir Warren Archdeacon, Knight, by the which Margaret
he had issue John, who married Alice, daughter of
Walter Killrington, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he had issue John
fourteenth Earl of Oxford, that died without issue 14th
July 1526 [See <span class="sc">Killygarth</span>], upon whom she settled
most of her lands, and deprived her issue by Seyntaubyn
thereof.</p>

<p>Thomas Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 37
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> Thomas Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of
Cornwall 30 Elizabeth. John Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was
Sheriff of Cornwall 11 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> John Seyntaubyn,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> who married
Godolphin, and had issue John Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
(my very good friend) that married Anne, one of the
coheirs of James Jenkyn, of Trekininge, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who by
letters patent, bearing date 11 March 24 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was
created the 797th Baronet of England. He had issue by
her, Sir John Seyntaubyn, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> that married De la Hay,
and had by her issue another Sir John Seyntaubyn, now
in possession of this place.</p>

<p>This famous worthy family, as it descended downwards,
married Sergreaulx, Colshill, Whittington, Grenvill,
Mallett, Godolphin, and others. The arms of
Seyntaubyn are, Ermine, on a cross Gules five Bezants.
And the said family was denominated from Mount
Seyntaubyn in Normandy. Finally, as Sergreaulx’s
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pageno">263</span>
heir, after the death of Sir Guy Seyntaubyn, passed
away her lands from her issue by him to her children
by her second husband, the Earl of Oxford aforesaid;
so Jenkyn’s heir, after the death of Sir John Seyntaubyn,
<abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> disinherited her heir by him, and sold most of her
lands for the payment of her second husband’s debts,
Mr. Spencer, of Lancashire; and after his death married
one Mr. Page, for whose benefit she did her son Seyntaubyn
what further damage she was able to perform by
sale of more of her lands. So unconstant and irregular
are some women’s affections.</p>

<p>Tregeare or Tregeire, Cornish Saxon, in this parish,
id est, the dwelling of honour, or the honourable dwelling,
gave name and original to a British family, from
thence denominated De Tregeare. It is now in the possession
of my very kind friend Richard Tregeare, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
Sheriff of Cornwall <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of Queen Anne, and Receiver of
the Land Tax <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> who married Rawle,
the relict of &mdash;&mdash;, but died without issue, who left
his estate to one of his name (though none of his tribe or
blood, as I am informed), who gave for his arms, in a
field Argent, a fess Gules, between three Cornish daws
Proper.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>For the name of this parish, it is in Cornish Crows-on,
the cross; probably so called from some notable cross
erected in the parish.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, I learn from others that the name is
derived from its female patroness, Sancta Crewenna,
and not from any noted cross. In the Lincoln Taxation
it is written Ecclesia Sancte Crewenne: which Crewenne,
says Leland, came over from Ireland with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Breage, or Breaca.</p>

<p>Mr. Tonkin reports what is stated by Mr. Hals of the
family of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, and adds, in the year 1733: This
<!--302.png--><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a><span class="pageno">264</span>
family has been no less than six times Sheriff of Cornwall.
They have served their prince and country, not
only in the office of sheriff, but also as members of parliament
and as justices of the peace.</p>

<p>The Sergreaulxes were of old a family of noble fame
and worth in this County. It appears, from Carew’s
Survey, that Richard de Sergreaulx held three fees by
the tenure of knights’ service, tempore Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> at
Killigarth, Lerneth, and Lonsallos. Also, he had Killcoid
(now Colguite) in the parish of Holland.</p>

<p>Tregeare, in this parish, Tre(g)eor (the g euphoniæ
gratiâ to avoid an elision), is the mansion of an old family
from thence denominated. Arms: Argent, a fess voided
Sable, charged with three Torteauxes between three
Cornish choughs Proper. Tregeare, interpreted, signifies
not only a dwelling in honour, but an honourable
dwelling; neither had the Saxon nor Kernawith Britons
any other word to express honour or honourable by than
the termination ge or gor, as appears not only from
that incomparable antiquary Verstegan,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_37" id="fnanchor_37"></a><a href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></span>
but also from
the names of divers places among our ancestors. I have
further to add respecting the word geor, and as we have
many places so called in the County I shall once for all
endeavour to give the true meaning of it.</p>

<p>Geare, fruitful, from guer, viridis, green (see Lhuyd’s
Archæologia, <abbr title="volume One, folio">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">I.</span>
fol.</abbr> Oxford, 1707, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 174,) as this
estate is at present, and as all others of the same name,
I presume, formerly were. The family of Tregeare are
said to date from before the Conquest.</p>

<p>Manor of Hellegar and Clowance: For Hellegar was
formerly the chief place, and signifies the hall or place
on the Downs; and there was lately standing there, and
I believe yet remains, a hall of large dimensions. This
<!--303.png--><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a><span class="pageno">265</span>
was anciently the seat of a family bearing the same
name; whose arms were, Gules, a bend Vaire between
six cross-crosslets Or. Sibill, one of the daughters
and co-heiresses of this house, married Pierce Kemell,
or Kymyell, of Kymyell, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Buian, whose arms were,
Argent, three dolphins in pale Sable. Elizabeth, one of
the daughters and coheiresses of Pearce Kemell, married
Geoffrey <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, the second son of Guy <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn,
Knight, and brought to him, with several other lands,
this manor of Hellegar and Clowance.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals commits an apparent mistake in assigning
the advowson of this parish to Mr. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn at the
period of Wolsey’s Valuation, and then stating that it
was acquired by purchase at the general dissolution of
religious houses.</p>

<p>It is probable that the advowson was acquired when
the alien priories, or all such houses as were cells in
England subject to monasteries abroad, were given to
the King by an Act of Parliament, <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> year of Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
A.D. 1415. See the statute in original Norman French,
<abbr title="volume Six, page">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">VI.</span> p.</abbr> 986,
of Dugdale’s Monasticon, London, 1830;
and in Latin, <abbr title="volume Nine, page">vol. <span class="muchsmaller">IX.</span>
p.</abbr> 281, of Rymer’s Fœdera.</p>

<p>Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, mentioned by Mr. Hals as in
possession of Clowance at the time of his writing, represented
the County in Parliament, and acquired popularity
by opposing the administration of Sir Robert Walpole.
He married Catherine, daughter, and eventually
coheiress of Sir Nicholas Morice, of Werrington, and
the Lady Catherine Herbert, and great-granddaughter
of Sir William Morice, Secretary of State at the Restoration.</p>

<p>This lady brought a fortune of ten thousand pounds,
which, the Editor remembers to have heard from a very
aged member of the family, were conveyed in two carts
<!--304.png--><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a><span class="pageno">266</span>
from Werrington to Clowance, all in half crowns, and
that he assisted in taling them.</p>

<p>But in addition to ten thousand pounds Miss Morice
also received at her marriage, or afterwards succeeded
to, the manor of Stoke Damarel, on the Eastern bank of
the Tamar, near Hamoaze, and purchased not a long
time before from the Wises, a respectable family in the
South of Devon, for eleven thousand five hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>On this manor all the dock yards and government
buildings have been constructed, and the whole town of
Plymouth Dock, now Devonport, has been built, together
with Morris Town, Stoke, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> so that the annual
income has risen to perhaps three or four fold the original
purchase money.</p>

<p>This Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn left a son of his own name,
and three daughters, who married Basset, Molesworth,
and Buller.</p>

<p>The son, Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, had also the honour of
representing the County in Parliament. He married
Miss Wingfield, from the North of England; and dying
in October 1772, left his estate to an only son, the present
Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn. He left also four daughters,
who have married Prideaux, Molesworth, Lennard, and
White.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons states that the church of Crowan was
given by William Earl of Gloucester to the Priory of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James, in Bristol, which was a Cell to Tewkesbury
Abbey. If that is so, Mr. Hals must be entirely mistaken
in assigning the advowson to a <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn at the
time of Wolsey’s Valuation.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons also says, that Kerthen, in this parish, belonged
to a family of the name of Cowlins, from whom
it passed to the Godolphins by a marriage.</p>

<p>Leland was entertained at Kerthen in the course of
making his Itinerary, by a Mr. Godolphin, who resided
there. Leland, however, writes the name Cardine.</p>

<p><!--305.png--><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a><span class="pageno">267</span>
In submitting to the press by far the greater part of
Mr. Hals’ Manuscripts, and also of Mr. Tonkin’s Manuscript,
in so far as it differs from the former, the Editor
has been especially careful to preserve all such anecdotes
and narratives of events as may tend to illustrate the
manners or the opinions of the times to which they relate,
adding to them many that have come to his knowledge
from other sources.</p>

<p>Just a hundred years ago such a series of events took
place with reference to the possession of Skewis, a farm
in this parish, as would induce any one of the present
time to think that he must be living in another land,
under a different administration of the laws, and in a
totally dissimilar state of society.</p>

<p>Skewis had been, for I know not how long, the freehold
patrimony of a succession of yeomen proprietors of
the name of Rogers. There were now two brothers, the
elder married and lived on the farm, but without a family,
the younger brother, Henry Rogers, married and had several
children. He carried on for several years in Helston
the trade of a pewterer, then of considerable importance
to Cornwall, although it is now lost. A large
portion of the tin was then exported in the shape of pewter
made into plates, dishes, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> all of which have been
superseded by earthenware. At the first introduction of
earthenware, provincially called clome, it was a popular
cry to destroy the clome, and to bring back the use of
tin. He had for some years retired to this parish.</p>

<p>I have made many diligent inquiries about Henry
Rogers, and they have not gone to represent him as a
bad man, but as one little in the habit of restraining his
passions, of great bodily strength, and of what is termed
a wilful disposition; and his prejudices were probably
supported by an opinion, still prevalent among country
people, that freehold lands, which have once descended
to an heir cannot be alienated by any possessor without
the concurrence of his heir.</p>

<p><!--306.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pageno">268</span>
The elder brother died, when a will was produced
giving all the freehold property to his widow, whose
maiden name was Millett. Henry Rogers averred, and
possibly believed, that the will was spurious, and would
be invalid at all events. Under that impression, and
despising legal remedies, he waited for an opportunity
when his sister-in-law was from home; he then turned
some female servants out of the house, and took forcible
possession. The widow of course appealed to the law, with
the voice of the whole country, however, against her;
and it is universally reported that Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn,
the principal gentleman of the parish, would have supported
Rogers in a legal proceeding. However that may
be, he prepared for violence, and refused to yield up possession
when judgment was given against him; so that
the Sheriff was at last directed to eject him by force.
But Rogers got several persons, ignorant and lawless as
himself, to remain with him in the house, which had
been barricaded and adapted for defence, and great
numbers of people, partly from curiosity, but in part
also to countenance his resistance, having assembled on
the spot, the civil power was completely resisted, and
two men killed by shots from the house; the Under
Sheriff himself having narrowly escaped,&mdash;as he states in
his evidence, rather ludicrously, that the discharge of a
gun from the house burnt his wig and singed his face.</p>

<p>This happened on the 18th of June, 1734.</p>

<p>On the following day the Under Sheriff came
back, assisted by some soldiers, who were fired on and
one killed. They returned the fire, but without effect.
And then, which would appear almost incredible, Rogers
was allowed to remain in quiet possession, after these
murders, till March of the following year, when he was
again blockaded by soldiers; and the siege, I apprehend,
continued for several days, with the loss of two more
men, when at last cannon were brought from Pendennis
Castle. On the night following their arrival, Rogers
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pageno">269</span>
contrived to effect an escape. He travelled on foot, and
got as far as Salisbury, with the intention, as he stated,
of making his case known to the King.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the opinions of gentlemen,
and educated persons, on the abstract merit of his case,
it became impossible for them not to join in bringing to
condign punishment one who had thus taken away the
lives of innocent persons, and set at equal defiance the
laws of God and man.</p>

<p>Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn now took an active part in endeavouring
to secure the fugitive, and being through his
marriage connected with the Herberts Earls of Pembroke,
who resided in the neighbourhood of Salisbury,
handbills descriptive of Rogers were circulated round
that town. I have always heard that a postboy, driving
homewards a return postchaise, was accosted by a stout
man walking with a gun in his hand, requesting to be
taken in. The boy drove him to the inn, where he procured
a bed; but the circumstances and description had
excited strong suspicion, and he was secured in his
sleep.</p>

<p>The prisoner was of course removed to Cornwall. He
was there convicted of murder, together with John
Street, who seems to have been his principal partisan,
and both made an atonement for their offences with
their lives.</p>

<p>Through the favour of Lord Hardwicke, I have procured
a copy of the evidence, and a portion of the
charge given to the Grand Jury, in reference to those
prisoners, by his Lordship’s grandfather, the justly-celebrated
first Earl of Hardwicke and Lord Chancellor.</p>

He said that then he might deliver possession and appeal.
Swore, damn him, he would not deliver possession.
Saw two or three hundred people. Read the proclamation.
The prisoner fired a gun, burned his wig,
and singed his face. One of his officers said he was shot
through the head. Expostulated again. Then he
swore if the King and Lord Chancellor came he would
not deliver it. Several guns were fired. He told him
he would give him time till tomorrow morning eight
o’clock. Sent to Captain Sadler for a few soldiers;
the captain sent them; he went with them; he demanded
entrance. Prisoner said, “Damn you, are you
come again?” A gun was mounted out of the hole cut
in the door within an inch of his body; discharged; and
it shot Carpenter, who fell with it, and said he was a
dead man. Another gun fired, and shot Hatch, his
servant. Rogers had a gun in his hand when he first saw
him, and afterwards came out with a gun in his hand.
Carpenter was a bailiff to the sheriff, and he had commanded
him to go to his assistance. Mrs. Rogers, the
plaintiff, was there both times.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><!--309.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pageno">271</span>
<span class="speaker">George Ellis.</span> 18 June was desired by Mrs. Rogers to
go with them. Rogers and his wife in the window, and
had a gun between them. Mr. Tillie demanded possession.
Prisoner said he would not; swore and cursed,
and said he had strength enough to defend his possession
against any person; insisted the estate was his.
The Under-sheriff expostulated with him, and told him
if he had a right, his best way was to submit to the law.
Sheriff read the proclamation. Rogers asked him to
drink a dram; he went for it, and in the meantime his
wife held the gun; guns were fired.</p>

<p class="blockquote">19  June went again. Under-sheriff told him he
hoped he was in a better mind now, and would deliver
him possession. Refused. A gun fired from the house.
Soon after, heard it called out that Carpenter was shot in
the back, and a soldier shot in the groin. He is a surgeon,
and dressed Carpenter; found him shot from
about the fourth rib to his buttock; many slugs and
jagged pieces of lead in it.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Between two and three hundred men there the first
day, and a great many the second day, but not so many.
Sir J. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubin having sent out his steward, heard the
under-sheriff ask him who were in the house. He said
only his own servants.</p>

<p class="blockquote">No gun was fired, or any force used by any of the
Under-sheriff’s company till Carpenter was shot.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Mr. Lukey</span>, surgeon. Found a gun-shot wound in the
small of his back. He saw him on Wednesday the 19th,
died on Friday. It was a great quantity of small shot;
thinks the wound went through into his belly.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Samuel Hatch</span>, servant to Mr. Tillie, the Under-sheriff.
18th was there. The Under-sheriff read the King’s writ to
him. He did not see who fired the gun, but saw no man
in the house that day but Rogers, whom he knows.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Cannot say he saw Rogers fire the first time. Carpenter
was shot, and another soldier shot, and two men
wounded before any of the soldiers or Sheriff’s company
fired. He was shot with slugs.</p>

<span class="speaker">Richard Vinsam.</span> Was there the first day, and the
Sheriff read and showed him the writ; told Rogers that
if he would try the cause again he should be as ready
to put him in as to take him out. He was there again
the second day. The Sheriff told him he was come again
to do his office, and desired him to be easy. Gives the
same account, and that the soldiers did not fire till after
Carpenter was shot.</p>

<p class="center">As to Street.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Edward Williams.</span> Was at Skewis House the 19th day
of June 1734. Saw John Street there in the house, with
a sword in his hand. Kept people in the house, and
said he would run any body through that offered to go
away; said now was the time to do a friend service; assisted
Rogers by keeping persons in by force; the Sheriff
was then come to demand possession.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Street was in the house when the firing was.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Rogers’s wife was apprehended by the time the Under-sheriff
came to the house.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Mr. Black</span>, ensign, was there with the soldiers; with
the others; had orders from the commanding officer to
attend the Sheriff. No firing by the soldiers or sheriff’s
company till Carpenter and a soldier killed.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">John Ellett</span> was one of the soldiers who went with the
Under-sheriff to assist him. Agrees with the rest, that
Carpenter was shot from that part of the house where
he saw Rogers. There was no firing by the soldiers or
the sheriff’s assistants till Carpenter was wounded.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Henry Jeffries</span> was corporal to the party. Heard the
Under-sheriff read the proclamation, and demand entrance;
when Rogers refused.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Carpenter went up and struck at the door; and as he
turned about was shot in the back; he was shot in the
leg; had orders from the Under-sheriff to fire.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The <span class="speaker">Prisoner</span>. Had good counsel, and thought he
had a good right to the estate; was unwilling to deliver
it up the first day; told him he intended to appeal; said

if he did not deliver possession he might bring a writ of
rebellion against him. Sheriff swore he would have
possession. Sheriff went off, and he did not expect to
see him again. Next morning heard the soldiers were
coming. Sent his wife out; they seized her. With
beat of drum the Sheriff and soldiers came and fired at
him; the soldiers fired about five rounds apiece.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Henry Berriman.</span> 18 day of June saw the sheriff go,
and heard him demand entrance; and the prisoner said
he should have none. The next day the Sheriff came
with soldiers; but he was two coits cast off; the soldiers
were on the eastern side of the house; the soldiers fired
three rounds; but he did not see the gun fired out of the
house. Carpenter was shot on the eastern side of the
house, and he was on the western side of the house; the
Undersheriff desired him to carry him off. Did not see
Carpenter receive the shot. Was not on the same side
of the house when Carpenter was shot; as far off as the
tower of this town from this place.</p>

<p class="blockquote">[Carpenter was on the eastern side of the house when
he was shot].</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Thomas Pendarves.</span> Rode through the town just as the
soldiers came with the Sheriff; saw Henry Rogers’s
wife; was on the south side of the house when the firing
was first; but that was on the east side of the house;
however, thinks he could distinguish whether it came
from the house or the soldiers, because the firing from
the house was by single pops now and then, and the
soldiers shot many together. To his sight and perception
the first firing was by the soldiers. Can’t say any
more. He was not on the east of the house at all. A
great number of people assembled.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Henry Johns</span> was in company with Carpenter; said he
forgave Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">John Rogers</span> saw Carpenter in his bed, and drank
with him. He asked how he came to throw a great
stone. He said he did not know; but he freely forgave

Second day after Carpenter was shot, Henry Rogers
came to the window with his gun on the east side,
fired, and a shot went through his hat, and a soldier
wounded. He ordered the soldiers to fire. Woolston was
on the west side, and was shot there. No gun was
fired by the soldiers, or any person in the assistance of
the sheriff, nor a sword drawn, nor any force, till after
Carpenter was shot and Hatch wounded, and Jeffries
shot through the leg. Woolston declared that Rogers
had shot him, on his asking him. Died in about half an
hour after. Soldiers went to the assistance of him;
ordered them to use no force till resistance.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">John Ellet.</span> He was on the east side of the house; he
carried off Woolston; was shot from the waistband of
his breeches to the buckle of his shoes. Gives the same

killed. The officer ordered him to go with ten men to
the west side of the house. As soon as he came into

and fire his gun and shot Woolston, of which he died in
an hour.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="decoration">Cross-examined.</span> After Carpenter was killed, some of
the soldiers had fired on the east side of the house before
he went to the west side.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Samuel Hatch</span> gives the same account as before of the
facts on 18th and 19th June. The first guns which were

No firing by the soldiers, or any in assistance of the
sheriff, till after one was killed and two wounded.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">George Ellis.</span> The same as before. Saw Woolston go
with the soldiers to the west side of the house. Soon
afterwards heard a cry that Woolston was shot. Went
and saw him. He was shot from the groin to the ancle.
He was then in a manner dying; died of that wound.
The first firing from within the house, before the Sheriff
had finished the concluding words of the proclamation;
three guns fired before the soldiers fired.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Richard Vinsam.</span> Saw Rogers looking out at the window.
Several guns fired before the Sheriff had quite
finished the proclamation. No guns fired by the soldiers

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Mr. Black.</span> After the firing from the east side, ordered

his men.”</p>

drawn. He asked to go out. Street said if he offered to
do it he would run him through; hindered him and another
from going out; said if they would do a friend any
good or service now was the time; the service was to
keep the possession against the Sheriff. The prisoner
Rogers thought his appeal had been lodged.</p>

of murders that he had committed. Tubby was

about sixty yards from the house, and he saw a gun
fired from a window of the house; immediately on that
Tubby fell down; he ran off; immediately saw Rogers
in the window from which the fire came; afterwards saw
Rogers come out to the man and walk round him and
take Tubby’s gun, but before Rogers came out another
gun was fired; saw one or two more at the window afterwards;
intended to apprehend him and bring him to
Launceston.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">John Williams.</span> Was with Bennett and Tubby at the
constable’s desire to take Mr. Rogers, but ordered them
not to shoot without necessity; about sixty yards off the
house saw Tubby on his knee, almost before he heard
the report of the gun; immediately saw Rogers in the
window with a gun in his hand; thought Rogers was
gone out of his house. Tubby cried, “Lord! Lord!” and
fell down. Another gun fired, and he crept away through
the hedge.</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Henry Thomas.</span> Saw Rogers on 16th March, with a
gun, walk by the dead body forwards and backwards.
Said, “Here lies the black Bill.”</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Henry James.</span> Was called to assist William John the

saw the prisoner with a gun within twelve feet of the
body. Prisoner said, “Sir Andrew, thou didst make thy
brag last Sunday that thou wouldst lend me a brace of
bullets, but I think I have paid thee.” Asked them to
come in and drink a dram; refused. He said, “If he
would, he would make them come into the castle.” They
went away, and we retired. Rogers stood in the lane
with a gun in his hand, bid them turn in; said, Sir
John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn would be angry if they had any thing
to do with any body in the house. He said, “Damn
them, if they did not he would shoot them.” Asked, if
they knew who killed the man? “No.” Said, “There was
a black man lay dead in the moor, if any body would
own him they should have him. I have the bill;” produced

say, “Take up the man.” He ran out, and Rogers looked
out of his window, asked, what he was going for? said,
“To see what you have done; you will be hanged at
last.” Said, “If you do not go back, I will shoot you
too.” Said to him, “Did not I tell you to tell Sir
John, that I would take them off as he would fetch
them.” He said “fetch them?”</p>

<p class="blockquote"><span class="speaker">Prisoner.</span> That these people followed him and endeavoured

<p class="blockquote">Of the truth of this observation and of the pernicious
consequences of lawless force, you of this country have
lately had a flagrant but an instructive instance. In that
you have seen from what small springs a torrent of violence
may arise. How people once engaged in such
practices, go on from invading the property, to taking
away the lives of their fellow subjects; and from an obstinate
contemptuous opposition to the regular decisions
of the ordinary Courts of Justice, they advance almost to
open rebellion.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The honourable and indefatigable endeavours of the
gentlemen of this county to reform and suppress such
daring outrages cannot be sufficiently commended, and
must always be remembered highly to their honour. And
happy it is that these endeavours, enforced by the seasonable
and gracious assistance of his majesty, had the
desired effect. To consider this affair in its full extent,
it ought on the one hand to be looked upon as a strong
proof that the King will make use of the extraordinary
<!--317.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pageno">279</span>
as well as the ordinary powers of his government, only
for protection and security of his people; and on the
other hand, that the gentlemen of England will unite in
the support of the laws, and of legal, well established
government, against all attempts of any kind whatsoever
to introduce disorder and confusion.</p>

<p class="p2">So great were the apprehensions entertained of a man
who had in this extraordinary manner, and for months
set at defiance the whole authority of the country, that,
immediately after his absconding, the magistrates of the

<p class="p2 hanging">Cornwall.&mdash;To all Magistrates, Headboroughs, and Officers

guard of soldiers and others which were placed about
the house at Skewis to prevent their escape, and any
further mischiefs that might ensue from their wicked intentions
and intrigues of the said Henry Rogers and his
abettors; And whereas they withdrew from Skewis with
their guns and ammunition, whereby it is suspected that
they will plunder and ravage the whole county:&mdash;We
therefore desire you to transmit this to the next town,
that it may go through the whole county, not only that
all his Majesty’s good and peaceable subjects may be
guarded against the said Rogers and his gang, but that

<p class="blockquote">There is a reward of 350<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> for taking him. He hath
on a whitish fustian frock, with bastard pearl buttons,
and a blue riding-coat.</p>

<p class="p2">Although no one ventured to justify the violence, and
especially the murders committed by Rogers, yet long
within my remembrance a strong feeling of compassion
was generally entertained for him. One of his sons
lived to a very advanced age at Penzance, where he
procured a scanty living as a saddler, merely employed,
I believe, from kindness.</p>

<p>In October 1812 I had a long conversation with this
old man about his father; and the following are minutes
made on the occasion:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the 30th of October, 1812, I called on Mr. Henry
Rogers, formerly a saddler at Penzance, but then residing
there in great poverty, being supported by a small
allowance from a club, and by half-a-crown a week given
him by the corporation, nominally for yielding up the
possession of a house, but in truth to prevent his becoming
a common pauper.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Mr. Henry Rogers was then eighty-four years of age,
and remembered the unfortunate transactions at Skewis
perfectly well; he was between seven and eight years old
at the time. He recollected going out with his father into
the court after there had been some firing. His father
had a gun in his hand, and inquired what they wanted.
<!--319.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pageno">281</span>
On this his father was fired at, and had a snuff-box and
powder-horn broken in his pocket by a ball, whilst he
stood on the other side.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“He recollected that whilst he himself was in the bed,
several balls came in through the window of the room,
and after striking against the wall rolled about on the
floor.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“One brother and a sister, who were in the house,
went out to inquire what was wanted of their father, and
they were not permitted to return.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“On the last night, no one remained in the house but
his father, himself, and the servant-maid. In the middle
of the night they all went out, and got some distance
from the house. In crossing a field, however, they were
met by two soldiers, who inquired their business, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>
The maid answered that they were looking for a cow,
when they were permitted to proceed. The soldiers had
their arms, and his father had his gun. The maid and
himself were left at a farm-house in the neighbourhood,
and Mr. Rogers proceeded on his way towards London.
Mr. Henry Rogers said that he was born in Crowan, and
he apprehended so were most of the children; that his
father, although bred a pewterer, had for many years
occupied land in that parish.”</p>

<p>All these circumstances, after so long an interval, were
related to me by the old man with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>It is curious to compare this account of the escape of
one man, a woman, and a child, with the proclamation
of the next day.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January, 1816, I called at Skewis, and
saw several holes in the partitions, made by shot of different
sizes, when Mr. Henry Rogers resisted the law in
1735.</p>

<p>I have an extract from a letter written by a Cornish
gentleman in May 1735, who states that he had seen
Rogers in the prison at Salisbury, when he seemed to rejoice
in what he had done. And I have found in an account-book
<!--320.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pageno">282</span>
of my great uncle, Mr. Henry Davies, the
following receipt:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“1st July 1735. Received of Mr. Henry Davies, towards
the taking of Henry Rogers, two pounds two
shillings, per Francis Arthur.”</p>

<p class="p2">A print of Rogers was soon after published with the
following legend:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Henry Rogers lived at a village called Skewis. He
was so ignorant of the reason as well as of the power of
the law, that when a decree in Chancery went against
him, he resisted all remonstrances, and fortified his house,
making loopholes for his muskets, through which he shot
two men of the posse comitatus who attended the Under-sheriff.
A little after he shot one Hitchens, as he was
passing the high road on his private business. He also
fired through the window and killed one Toby, and would
not suffer his body to be taken away to be buried for some
days. At length the neighbouring justices of the peace
assisted the constables, and procured an aid of some soldiers,
one of whom he killed, and afterwards made his
escape; but at Salisbury, on his way towards London, he
was apprehended and brought down to Cornwall, when at
the assizes in August 1735 five bills of indictment were
found againt him by the grand jury for the five murders
aforesaid; to save the court time he was tried only on
three of them, and found guilty of every one, before
Lord Chief Justice Hardwick. As he lay in gaol after
his conviction, the Under-sheriff coming in, he attempted
to seize his sword, with a resolution to kill him; swearing
he should die easy if he could succeed in that design.
He was attended by several clergymen; but they could
make no impression on his brutal stupidity, and he died
at the gallows without any remorse.”</p>

<p class="center">Launceston, August 1.</p>

<p class="blockquote">This day came on before the Lord Chief Justice Hardwick,
the trials of Henry Rogers and John Street, one of
his assistants, for murders committed in opposing the
Sheriff of Cornwall in the execution of his office.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Rogers was arraigned upon five indictments, and Street
upon two. The trials began about seven in the morning
and ended about two in the afternoon. Rogers was tried
upon the three first indictments, and being found guilty
on all three, the Court thought it unnecessary to proceed
upon the other two. Street was found guilty of the two
indictments against him. And they both received sentence
of death before the Court rose.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Counsel for the king were Mr. Serjeant Chapple,
Mr. Fortescue, jun. The Counsel for the criminals Mr.
Pratt and Mr. Draper. The Solicitor for the Treasury
Richard Paxton, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was also there on the part of the
Crown, he being sent down purposely to prosecute the
affair.</p>

<p class="p2 blockquote">At the assizes at Launceston Henry Rogers and John
Street received sentence of death for a murder they committed
in opposing the Sheriff of Cornwall in the execution
of his office, and were executed on the 6th of August
1735. They seemed very penitent, particularly Rogers,
who did not care for any sustenance but bread and
water. He said he was guilty of one of the murders,
but knew nothing of the other; but had it been in his
power he would have killed as many more, and thought
he committed no crime. Street, who was his servant,
<!--322.png--><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a><span class="pageno">284</span>
had little to say, but that what he did was to defend his
master, and he was willing to die, for by the course of
years he could not live much longer, and he hoped God
would receive his poor soul.</p>

<p>And lastly, I subjoin an address to the parish of
Crowan, by Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, the gentleman whom I
have mentioned as one of the opponents of Sir Robert
Walpole’s administration.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As I am obliged to attend at the assizes, I must earnestly
recommend the care of the parish in my absence
to you, and hope that you will do your endeavours to
prevent the very great expense and mischief which must
otherwise fall upon us; although you do not at present
seem to perceive the danger that threatens us; for the
outrage and murder which happened in our parish have
justly alarmed the government, and induced his majesty
to issue out a proclamation, wherein he offers a
reward of two hundred pounds for apprehending Henry
Rogers, and one hundred pounds for each of the other
offenders, together with a pardon to any who shall discover
and apprehend them. He likewise commands all
civil magistrates, upon pain of his majesty’s displeasure,
to be diligent in suppressing this riot, and bringing the
authors of it to the punishment which their crimes deserve.
In obedience to this, I think myself obliged, in
the faithful discharge of my duty for the preservation of
the public peace, and the good of our own parish in particular,
to admonish you and the principal inhabitants
of it, to give me your aid and assistance in this dangerous
and troublesome affair. His Majesty, as he declares in the
proclamations, being firmly resolved to put an effectual
stop to such enormous practices, hath by his warrant
from the Secretary of War, sent orders to the commanders
of regiments of soldiers at Exeter, to send to the Sheriff
so many soldiers as he shall require and think sufficient
<!--323.png--><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a><span class="pageno">285</span>
to suppress this notorious violation of the laws of the
land, and which certainly will be done by force of arms,
if it cannot be stopped by a gentle and careful process.
This is a true and exact state of cause; and whoever
considers it with due temper, must be filled with the most
melancholy apprehensions of the mischief that must happen,
if every good subject and Christian does not endeavour
to keep off this evil, by endeavouring, as far as his
influence can prevail, to make the usual method of
bringing crimes to justice effectual. It is for this reason
I now write this letter to you, which I hope you
will read with serious attention more than once, that it
may have a good effect upon you. I myself can foresee,
and I wish you likewise could, the dreadful inconvenience
and expense of a regiment of soldiers sent down
and quartered upon us; particularly this parish, being
the unfortunate place of this disorder, must, in a much
heavier manner, feel the burthen of it. Consider the
charges and the trouble of having every house in the
parish filled with soldiers; consider what must be the
consequence of abetting and supporting Rogers, whose
house will be fired about his ears, and those lives which
may be lost if he continues in his extravagance. Take
notice, that I have done my duty as justice of the peace
and a parishioner; and if you all likewise do yours, by
encouraging a proper subjection to authority, and aiding
the civil magistrates in discovering and bringing
the offenders to justice, these dismal calamities may be
prevented. I think more reasonable to advise you of
this, because there is too general a mistake and prejudice,
or rather vicious encouragement shown, and that
too by many who should and do know better, to the unhappy
author of this disturbance. To pity the unfortunate
is a virtuous character, even to those whose vices
have made them so; but at the same time we ought to
detect their crimes, and it is for the public good they
<!--324.png--><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a><span class="pageno">286</span>
should be punished; and this consideration ought to
prevail over the concern we may feel for a private person.
Murder is a crime of the basest nature, and what
the law in common cases never forgives; but when it is
committed on any officer in the execution of his duty,
and in supporting the usurpation of another’s right,
and what the law shall determine such, it is certainly a
more complicated guilt. Whosoever abets a murderer, or
does what he can to conceal and defend him from justice,
is in the eye of God a murderer himself in cold
blood. To justify a murderer is the strongest indication
of a most base temper; and whosoever does not cry out
against the misguided spirit of the people in behalf of
Henry Rogers, deserves that character. Whilst the lawsuit
was depending all people were at liberty to weigh
on either side. It does at first sight seem a little hard
that one brother should give away an estate from another;
and there must be some strong provocation to
make it appear reasonable; but the circumstances of
the whole case are not known, and therefore no man is
able to form a true judgement of it; not even to pass
harsh censures on particular persons; but when the law
has determined right, all people must submit to that determination;
otherwise no man is secure in his property,
but a number of idle resolute fellows may wrest it from
him, and declare that in their opinion he has an unjust
title to it. So that if you give your estate by will
unequally among your children, as they may have behaved
more or less dutiful to you, that which has the
least may take the other’s part from him; or another
relation may possibly hire such another mob, to take
away the whole from them. We shall not at such times
see property determined by judge and jury, but by force
of arms; and the richest and most powerful man will
be able to swallow up all the estates of his lesser neighbours.
The law is the only protection of our lives and
<!--325.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pageno">287</span>
estates, and if that is once set aside, we must hold them
only by the base sanction of a giddy rabble. The law
therefore should be strictly maintained by all such who
have any possessions. The inferior people indeed, who
have nothing to lose, will be at all times for breaking
down the fences, that they may have some share of the
common plunder. I should mention one instance. Suppose
any of you had bought this estate of the late Rogers,
being advised by your lawyer that he had the
power to sell it, (which he certainly had, as the law has
declared he had a right of giving it away,) you would
then think it very hard that the present Rogers, with his
wicked crew, should come and take it away by force, and
afterwards keep it as he now does. Suppose the money
you paid him for it he gave to his widow; should you in
such a case agree that ’tis his brother’s right to have the
estate? Let every one make this his own case.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“I believe you all honest men, and wo’nt suspect any
one of you of justifying this affair; but I have put these
arguments into your mouths to warn other people from
this vicious way of thinking, and that you may exert
yourselves in keeping this hardship from the parish, from
which I could never learn this Rogers deserved so much
kindness as to suffer on his account; for he never paid
church, priest, or poor, when he was in possession of
the estate, and withheld from many their just due. The
character of the honest and just man is to relieve the
poor, to pity the unfortunate; but to use their utmost
endeavours to punish the guilty, and to recommend and
enforce an obedience to the laws of the land, which are
the only protection of our lives and properties.”</p>

<p>This parish, which is adjacent to that of Comborne,
is composed of the same kind of rocks. The eastern
half reposes on granite, the western on slate. Like
Comborne it has long been celebrated for its mines.
Although its general aspect is dreary and barren, yet it
contains some very fertile spots; that of Clowance in
particular gladdens the eye; the rich and intrinsic beauties
of its pleasure grounds and extensive plantations
being heightened by the contrast of surrounding desolation.</p>

<p>The history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert.&mdash;He was born in Cumberland,
of British Saxon parents, about the year 600; and
had his Christian education as a monk in Bangor Monastery,
in Ireland; from whence he removed to the abbey of Landisfarne,
opposite to Northumberland and North Durham,
where, after he had remained some years, he was chosen
or made a bishop of that diocese. I remember to have
seen in this church, painted against the wall, about thirty
years past, the portraiture of a bishop, attired in his episcopal
robes, with mitre or crown on his head, a crosier or
shepherd’s crook or staff in his hand, and an inscription
in ancient character near it, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbertun.
Which picture, I am told, is since covered over with lime by the
churchwardens.</p>

<p><!--328.png--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pageno">290</span>
Now, it happened after the death of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, that
the island of Landisfarne was extremely troubled with the
piratical thievish Danes, who wasted the same, without regard
of secular or religious persons and places. Whereupon
the Bishop of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ethelwin, with his monks, privately
escaped into Northumberland, and left their houses and
estates a prey to their enemies, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 800, carrying
with them as their chief treasure the enshrined relics or
skeleton of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, with which, during the lives of
twelve titular bishops of Landisfarne, they wandered up
and down Northumberland for the space of ninety years,
without any fixed place of abode or settlement, till Aldwyn,
titular bishop of that island, obtained leave of King
Alfred, <abbr title="anno Domini">ann. Dom.</abbr> 890, to pitch and settle his episcopal
church at Durham, where he and his monks laid the
foundation thereof; which, after it was by them finished,
was consecrated and dedicated to the honour of Almighty
God in the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuthbert, where they again erected
his shrine or relics; thereby transferring or translating
the bishopric of Landisfarne to that place, and no more
styling themselves bishops thereof, but of Durham.</p>

<p>But this fabrick of Bishop Adelwyn, though a stately
church, was pulled down by William Carilepho, the 29th
bishop (13 <abbr title="William One">Will. I.</abbr> 1080), who in the place thereof laid
the foundation of that cathedral church now extant there;
though he did not live to see it finished; but Ralph Flambard,
his successor, Lord Treasurer of England, went on
with the work, and brought it to that perfection it now
showeth; though some additions indeed were made by Nicholas
de Farnham, and Thomas Welscomb, prior thereof,
1242.</p>

<p>King Alfred, and Guthrun the Dane, his deputy-governor
of Northumberland, gave much lands to this church
between the rivers Tees and Tyne, which King Alfred confirmed
by his charter.</p>

<p>In William the Conqueror’s days it was reputed a
county palatine or principality, and did engrave upon its
<!--329.png--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pageno">291</span>
seal an armed chevalier, holding a naked sword in one
hand, and in the other the arms of the bishopric, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>
Azure, a plain cross between four lions rampant Or.</p>

<p>But the immunities of this church of Durham were
shortened by the statute 27 Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, and the lordly absolute
power of this bishopric conferred upon the king.
Afterwards, <abbr title="tempore Edward Six">temp. Edw. VI.</abbr> the lands and whole title of
the bishopric of Durham was by act of parliament conferred
upon that king, which act was repealed 1 Queen
Mary, when the dissolved bishopric and the royalties of it
were in a measure revived and restored as it now stands.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">In</span> this parish is that famous and well-known spring of
water called Holy-well (so named the inhabitants say, for that
the virtues of this water was first discovered on Allhallows-day).
The same stands in a dark cavern of the sea-cliff
rocks, beneath full sea-mark on spring-tides; from the top
of which cavern falls down or distils continually drops of
water, from the white, blue, red, and green veins of those
rocks. And accordingly, in the place where those drops of
water fall, it swells to a lump of considerable bigness, and
there petrifies to the hardness of ice, glass, or freestone, of
the several colours aforesaid, according to the nature of
those veins in the rock from whence it proceeds, and is of
a hard brittle nature, apt to break like glass.</p>

<p>The virtues of this water are very great. It is incredible
what numbers in summer season frequent this place and
waters from counties far distant.</p>

<p>Chynowen, now Chynoweth, id est, New-house, was the
voke-lands of a considerable manor, under which jurisdiction
this parish was taxed, 20 Will. <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, from which
place was denominated an old British family of gentlemen,
now in possession thereof, surnamed De Chynoweth;
which (were not comparisons odious) I would, for antiquity,
rank with or before the tribe of any other family extant in
this province; though I do not understand their estate, or
post in the public service of their country, was ever above
<!--330.png--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pageno">292</span>
the degree of a juryman of the parish of Chynoweth (now
Cuthbert), or that of a hundred constable; for, if tradition
may be credited, some of this blood were possessed of those
very lands before the Norman Conquest, and then at
length, after the manner of the French, writ de Chynoweth.</p>

<p>The present possesser, John Chynoweth, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> giveth
for his arms, Sable, on a fess Or, three eagles’ heads erased
Gules.</p>

<p>Carynas, or Carrynas, id est, dead carrions, in this parish,
it seems, was so denominated from the lodging of
such dead bodies of bullocks, horses, or sheep, as died of
age, poverty, or sickness, and were either on trees, or in
carrion pools, laid up here for hunters or their dogs. It is
the dwelling of John Davis, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Lannar,
alias Vincent; his father Hoblyn, of Penhall; his grandfather.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>By the register of this parish (which is very ancient) it
appears that in the year 1569 there was a great plague
here, by which died, from the 20th of August to the 10th
of November, seventy people, and it then abating, from
the 25th of December to the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of February fifteen more;
which is the more considerable, for that in the parish at
present, in its flourishing condition, there are not above
three hundred and fifty souls; and so healthy is the place
in general, that I have been assured by Mr. Bradford, the
present Minister, there was not a single burial from the
12th of September, 1699, to the 18th of October, 1700,
the year following.</p>

<p>The Holy Well, if it may properly be so called, (it being
nothing but a little water dropping out of the cliff under
Kelsey, in a small cove made by the sea, to be come at
only when the tide is out,) has been much frequented of
late, and several strange cures attributed to it. It is a
water that petrifies of itself, as may be seen by the incrustations
<!--331.png--><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a><span class="pageno">293</span>
on the rock over which it runs; and these incrustations
make the ascent to it very slippery and dangerous.</p>

<p>The Manor of Hellanclose, that is, the four halls, belonged
to Robert Trencreek, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> fell to Degory Polwhele,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who sold it to Sir Richard Robartes, in whose
family it still is, Henry Earl of Radnor being the present
lord thereof. The barton has been in lease for four generations
to the Hoskins, the wealthiest farmers in those
parts. Mr. Joseph Hoskin is the present possessor.</p>

<p>The church is seated upon the top of a hill, and so visible
at a great distance.</p>

<p>One part of the parish is drowned in the sands, and that
promontory of land is called Kelsey, famous for feeding
the sweetest mutton (though but small) in England.</p>

<p>The history of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuby. He was the son to Solomon,
Duke, King, or Earl of Cornwall, about the year 350; and
being bred up a zealous Christian of the orthodox faith, and
finding the churches of Britain much pestered with the
heresy of the Arians, who denied the equality of the persons
in the Trinity or Godhead, holding one to be before or
superior to the other, Cuby not inclining to receive this
new doctrine, especially having read some of the writings
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers in Gaul, in opposition
thereto; he made addresses to that worthy father in order to
his better instruction; by whom he was kindly invited into
Gaul, and went there accordingly. He was so charmed with
the wisdom, piety, and holy doctrine of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, that he
became his disciple, and was by him ordained or consecrated
priest, and took upon him the office of a preacher; in which
capacity he grew so famous for his preachings in that country,
he was at length, by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, sent missioner of the
gospel into North Wales; and he proved so successful therein,
<!--333.png--><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a><span class="pageno">295</span>
that the greatest part of the people were converted to
the Christian faith, and the altars and images of Jupiter,
Mars, Apollo, Minerva, and other gods worshipped by the
Britons and Romans there, were thrown down and defaced.
Capgrave, who compiled his life, tells us that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Cuby wrought miracles, gave sight to the blind, cleansed
the leprous, caused the dumb to speak, cured the palsy,
and those possessed of devils. Moreover, saith he, Cuby
was in Ireland, where he preached the gospel, and built
churches there before <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick came into that country.
And he further saith of him, that he was very studious of
the peace of the church. And Bale tells us he was such a
self-denying man that, after his father’s death, he refused
the dominion of Cornwall, his fortune, and wealth, out of a
desire he had to acquire learning, and to preach the gospel.</p>

<p>Leland tells us in his Itinerary Manuscripts, that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Hilary made <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cuby Bishop of the Isle of Anglesey;
that he died about the year of our Lord 400; after his
death his disciples set up his shrine, that is, his bones,
in his church there; and when the Irishmen of Dublin, a
thousand years after, in June 1404, invaded the island and
found this relic, they carried away the same, and set it up
in the church of the Holy Trinity in Dublin. Nevertheless
there are still extant in the Isle of Anglesey three notable
monuments of him and his master, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Point Hilary,
Holyhead, and Caer-Cuby, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Cuby’s City or Castle.</p>

<p>That Tregony Borough was invested with the privileges
of a manor and court-leet, before the Norman Conquest,
Domesday Roll informs us. How long before by prescription,
no man living can tell. King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> (the Earldom
of Cornwall being then vested in the Crown) gave it
the freedom of sending two burgesses, citizens, or townsmen,
to sit in Parliament as its representatives, to be
chosen by the majority of the townsmen that were housekeepers;
which favour was obtained upon the humble petition
of Henry de Pomeroy, lord of this manor, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> of the
said Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> But this place was not incorporated but by
<!--334.png--><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a><span class="pageno">296</span>
the charter of King James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1621; and consists of a
mayor, recorder, and eight capital burgesses, the eldest of
which is justice of the peace for life within the borough. It
hath also a weekly market on Saturdays, and fairs yearly
upon May 3, July 25, September 1, November 6, and
Shrove Tuesday. The castle of Tregony, as tradition
saith, was built by the said Pomeroy, on behalf of John
Earl of Cornwall, in opposition to King Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> his
elder brother, then beyond the seas in the Holy War.
The chief inhabitants of this town are Mr. Tonkin, Mr.
Penlyer, Mr. Peters, Mr. Earle. The arms of which borough
are, a pine-apple, or pomegranate, on its stem, with
two leaves.</p>

<p>This Pomeroy was the descendant of Ralph de Pomeroy,
or Pomeraye, that came into England with William
the Conqueror, and was such a friend and favourite of his,
as Dugdale saith in his Baronage, that he conferred upon
him fifty-eight lordships, whereof this Tregony and Wich
(now Mary Wike) in Cornwall, were two; perhaps such
lands as fell to the Crown by virtue of their lord or owner’s
rebellion against the Conqueror in that insurrection at
Exeter, in the second year of his reign. This Ralph de
Pomeroy had issue Joel, that married one of the natural
daughters of King Henry <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> by Corbet’s daughter (mother
also by him of Reginald Fitz-Harry, Earl of Cornwall);
the which Joel had issue by her Henry and Josceline.
Henry married de Villie’s daughter, and by her had issue
Sir Henry de Pomeray, lord of this place, and Bury Pomeroy
in Devon, who sided with John Earl of Morton and
Cornwall against Richard <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> then beyond the seas; and
afterwards gave to the Knight Hospitallers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the
Baptist, the church of Maddarne in Penwith.</p>

<p>One Sir Roger Pomeray of this tribe cousin and heir
to Roger de Vallorta, lord of the castle of Trematon, dead
without issue male, did by deed 12 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> release to
Prince Edward, then created Duke of Cornwall, all his
right, title, and interest in the said castle and manor of
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pageno">297</span>
Trematon; in consideration whereof King Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
granted him and his heirs an annuity of 40<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, to
be paid out of the Exchequer. The last gentleman of
these Tregony Pomerays, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Elizabeth, left issue one
only daughter, married to Richard Penkivell, of Resuna,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in whom is terminated the name and estate of that
family, who gave for their arms, Or, a lion rampant Gules,
within a bordure engrailed Sable.</p>

<p>Mr. Penkivell, lord of this manor, borough, and leet,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> having wasted his whole patrimony in this
and other places, sold this manor of Tregony Pomeroy to
Hugh Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 10 Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
from whom it passed by descent to his son Hugh Boscawen,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> father of William Boscawen, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who settled it
as part of his wife’s jointure, on the Lady Anne FitzGerald,
daughter of the Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Charles Earl of Kildare,
who, over-living her husband, was married to Francis
Robartes, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> youngest son of the Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> John Earl
of Radnor, who is now, in her right, as freehold for life, in
full possession thereof. The arms of Penkivell are, in a
field Argent, two chevrons and in chief a lion passant Gules.</p>

<p>King John by virtue of his manor of Tybester (vide
<a href="#creed"><span class="sc">Creed</span></a>) granted the liberty of fishing, or the royalty of the
river Val, to one of the Pomeroys, lord of the manor.</p>

<p>To remove an action at law depending in the court-leet
of Tregony, the writ of certiorari, or avedas ad curiam, was
thus directed, as was also the precept for members of parliament.

though unfortunate gentleman, who at his own proper cost
and charges, and for his own benefit, by virtue of an act of
parliament, 19 Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> undertook to make the river Val
navigable as far as Crowe-hill, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s; and though
his first summer’s work seemed to favour his design, bringing
the salt water by two or three sluices above Tregony
Bridge, the place of its old flux and reflux, yet by reason of
the great and rapid confluence and washes of the Val river,
in the winter season, after the foundation of the walls of
those sluices being made upon mud or osier ground, where
the sea was driven back as aforesaid, were undermined, fell
down, and were comparatively driven away. However the
good undertaker was not discouraged at this misfortune, but
re-edified the same the summer following; and so on for
many summers after with greater skill, cost, and charges.
But alas! still the lofty current of the river Val, in winter
season, was such a malicious and invincible enemy to this
noble project, that, as before, it continually undermined the
walls of those sluices for about the space of twenty years,
so that the very worthy gentlemen aforesaid, in order honestly
to defray the charges of this work, hath spent the
greatest part of this fine estate, and given over his undertaking
as too difficult and unprofitable an enterprize.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker has collected every thing that can be
known or conjectured respecting the ancient state, not of
Tregony, but of a town or city supposed of great commercial
and ecclesiastical importance, which must have stood
nearly on the same spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker describes the ancient castle, and a priory
adjacent to it. The whole, including further particulars of
the patron saint, is much too long for this parochial history.

Bishop Tanner says of Tregony, in his Notitia Monastica,
the advowson of the Priory of Tregony, as belonging
to the Abbey of De Valle, in Normandy, is mentioned
fin. div. com. 52 Hen. <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> n. 18. Perhaps, instead of the
priory, it should have been only the rectory or church of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James, in Tregony; which, by means of some exchange,
was made over by the abbot and convent of De Valle to
the prior and convent of Merton, to whom it was appropriated,
and a vicarage endowed by Peter Quiril, Bishop of

<p>At the time of Domesday Roll (1087) this district was
taxed under the jurisdiction of Buchent, now Bochym,
that is to say, the cow, kine, or cattle house or lodge;
which place gave name and origin to an old family of gentlemen
surnamed de Bochym, tempore Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> who
were lords of this manor and barton, till such time as
John Bochym, tempore Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> entered into actual
rebellion against that prince, under conduct of Humphry
Arundell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Governor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s Mount, and
others, whose force and power being suppressed by John
Lord Russell, lieutenant-general of that prince at Exeter
(as is elsewhere shown), and those rebels attainted of high
treason, their lands were forfeited to the Crown. Whereupon
King Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> gave this barton and manor to
Reginald Mohun, sheriff of Cornwall 6 Edward <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> who
gave this barton of Bochym to one of his daughters, married
to Bellot, but settled it upon his great-grandson, William
Mohun, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now in possession thereof. Lastly, by
<!--340.png--><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a><span class="pageno">302</span>
this rebellion Bochym lost not only his lands, but his life
also. The arms of Bochym were, Argent, on a chief Sable
three mullets pierced of the Field.</p>

<p>If those Bellots came not into England with William
the Conqueror, they were of the number of those three
thousand French gentlemen that came out of France into
this land with Isabel, wife of King Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> who all
settled themselves in this kingdom, as our chronicles and
Verstegan testify. Since they came to Bochym they
married with Mohun, Monk, Pendarves; and the present
possessor, Renatus Bellot, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> one of her majesty’s commissioners
for the peace, married the inheritrix of Spour
of Trebatha, who is dead without issue. The arms of Bellot
are, in a field Argent, on a chief Gules three cinquefoils
of the Field.</p>

<p>Since the writing of the above, this estate of Bellot’s is
all spent by riot and excess, and, as I take it, the name extinct
in those parts; and this barton sold to Robinson.</p>

<p>Bonython is in this parish; from whence was denominated
an ancient family of gentlemen surnamed de Bonithon,
who for many descents flourished here in good reputation
till the reign of Queen Anne; at which time Charles
Bonython, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> serjeant-at-law, sold this barton to one
Carpenter, now in possession thereof. The arms of Bonithon
were, Argent, a chevron between three fleur-de-lis
Sable.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>Charles Bonython, of Bonython, in this parish, was a serjeant-at-law,
and steward of Westminster, which city he
also represented in parliament. He married Mary, the
daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Livesay, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Livesay, in Lincolnshire.
His father, John Bonython, married Ann, a daughter
of Hugh Trevanion, of Trelegon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> His grandfather,
Thomas Bonython, married Frances, the daughter
of Sir John Parker, of London.</p>

<p>From this place also were descended the Bonythons of
Carclew, in Milor.</p>

<p><!--341.png--><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a><span class="pageno">303</span>
This Charles Bonython, however, in a fit of madness
shot himself in his own house in London, leaving two sons,
Richard and John, and a daughter, married to Thomas
Pearse, of Helatin. Richard Bonython, the eldest son, a
very ingenious gentleman, was called to the Bar; but being
tainted likewise with his father’s distemper, first sold
portions of his estate in parcels, and at last this barton,
which had been so long in his family, to Humphry Carpenter,
jun.; and then, to complete the tragedy, for he
was never easy in his mind after this sale, first of all he set
fire to his chambers in Lincoln’s-inn, burnt all his papers,
bonds, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and then stabbed himself with his sword, but
not effectually; but he then threw himself out of the window,
and died on the spot.</p>

<p>John Bonython, the second son, was bred in King’s college,
Cambridge, and is now an eminent physician in
Bristol.</p>

<p>Roskymer Bonython, of this place, was Sheriff of Cornwall
in the 17th James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> A.D. 1619.</p>

<p>Bochym. In 1703 this barton belonged to Renatus
Bellot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who then represented the borough of Michell
in parliament. He married the inheritrix of Spoure of Trebartha.
He died of a fever in 1709, leaving an only son
of the same name, who died soon after his father, when the
estate was sold for the payment of debts to George Robinson,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who has made it his seat.</p>

<p>In this parish is the manor of Skewys, supposed to be so
called from skeu, a shadow. It was formerly the seat of a
family of the same name, of which John Skewys was sheriff
of the county in the 12th year of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Several supposed etymologies have been omitted from
Mr. Hals and from Mr. Tonkin, as being evidently unfounded.
Bonython appears to be derived from the well-known
word for an house, and possibly ethon, furze.</p>

Goonhilly Downs, which rest on a dark and rather hard
serpentine, spangled with small scales of diallage, and having
asbestos, indurated talc, and other magnesian minerals,
lining the joints, by which this rock may be easily split.
The remainder of the parish is composed of compact and
schistose hornblend rocks, of the calcareous series, which are
best exposed on the shores of Gunwalloe.</p>

<p>That this parish was called Davidstow from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David,
the titular saint of the Welsh, I make no question; for I
have never heard that the holy King David was ever enlisted
for the patron of a Christian church. I shall say no
more of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, than that he was uncle to King Arthur,
and therefore it is not wonderful that this church should
be dedicated to him; and that after he had attained the
age of a hundred and forty-six years he died at his
bishopric of Menevia, in Wales, since called from him <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
David’s, A.D. 642.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David appears to have been a very extraordinary
person, in reference to the period in which he lived. Giraldus
Cambrensis, in his Itinerarium Cambriæ, published
with annotations by David Powell, at London, 1585, 8vo.
and by Sir Richard Hoare, in 2 <abbr title="volumes quarto">vols. 4to.</abbr> 1806, gives
<!--344.png--><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a><span class="pageno">306</span>
many particulars of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, his predecessor in the
bishopric; and the praises bestowed by Giraldus on a
founder of monasteries may be esteemed deserving of credit,
as he was a professed and violent enemy to the monastic
orders. He is even said to have added to the Litany,
“A monachorum malitia libera nos, Domine,” in an age
when their power and influence were esteemed irresistible.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David is said to have been the son of Xantus, Prince
of Caretica, since named Cardiganshire. He was made a
priest early in life, and then participating in the opinion
universally prevalent, that the Deity would alone be propitiated
by men rendering themselves useless to their fellow-creatures,
by assuming almost the feelings and habits
of brute beasts, and by adding, so far as they were able, to
the misery and wretchedness of the human race, he betook
himself to an ascetic life in the Isle of Wight, under the
guidance of one Paulinus. But having at length acquired
a sufficient stock of reputed sanctity by these efficacious
means, he emerged like others from the desert, added to
the establishments at Glastonbury, or as some say refounded
the great work of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph of Arimathea, and
then created twelve monasteries in Wales.</p>

<p>But <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David owes the largest share of his popularity to
the active part which he took in the controversy at that
time dividing the Western church; one party maintaining
that it had pleased Almighty God to bestow at once on his
creatures, and from their births, the inclination and capability
of serving him; the other, that these gifts were reserved
for some future period, or dealt out from time to
time, and bit by bit. The latter opinion having been voted
to be the orthodox faith, was zealously supported by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
David against the former, known as the Pelagian heresy.</p>

<p>He certainly lived to a very advanced age, and was
buried in the cathedral at Menevia; from whence, we have
the testimony of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Kentigern that his soul was visibly
carried by angels into heaven. It is more certain that
about the year 962 his relics were transported to Glastonbury,
<!--345.png--><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a><span class="pageno">307</span>
as this transaction is circumstantially related by John
of Glastonbury, in his history of that splendid abbey,
published by Hearne.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David affords a remarkable instance, not merely of
the fact that events are wrested to suit the taste or the prejudices
of aftertimes, but of their being utterly inverted
and transformed.</p>

<p>When Eastern fictions became blended with the chivalry
of Europe, this anchorite, polemic divine, and apostle of
his native country, appeared as a military hero, expelling
the Saxons from Wales, at the head of an army in which
each individual was distinguished from their Pagan adversaries
by affixing to his helmet the plant which has since
been ever venerated by the Welch. And finally, Mr.
Richard Johnson, a canon of Exeter, having adopted the
mystical number seven for the Champions of Christendom,
and bestowed the undue proportion of four out of seven
on these Islands, makes <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David, the champion of Wales,
perform all the ordinary achievements of knight errantry,
and adding, as was highly proper, a spirit of gallantry to
that of valour, presents him as a lover eloping from Jerusalem
with an Hebrew princess, who on her part had previously,
by entreaties to her father, preserved the hero’s
life.</p>

<!--347.png--><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a><span class="pageno">309</span>
for wisdom, learning, arts and sciences. He was
descended of a rich and honourable family, morally just,
courteous, and loving to strangers. From his youth he was
bred up and addicted to learning, and became so eminent
therein, that he had a chief place amongst the magistrates
and rulers of the academy and city of Athens. He
was most elegant in the Attic tongue, as being the dialect of
his native country, and consequently a good rhetorician.
But that which made him more eminent was his skill in the
doctrine of the Stoics, Epicureans, and other philosophers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals continues through several pages the history of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Denis, but as the facts want altogether the support of
historical authority, and do not include the most interesting
of all, that of his walking from Montmartre, where the
sentence of decapitation was executed, to the place since
denominated from him, with his head under his arm, I
shall omit the whole; as also an account of blood having
fallen in this remote and sequestered churchyard, as the
best and most authentic mode of apprising the whole
nation that their fleet would be defeated by the Dutch,
and that a plague would break out in London; notwithstanding
that some of the stones, having blood upon them,
were seen by the author himself.</p>

<p>History of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick, abridged from Hals:</p>

<p>He was born at Calarvega in Spain, about the year 1167.
His father was Don Felix de Gusman, his mother Donna
Giovanna Deza, both well descended and faithful servants
of God. Dominick early distinguished himself by his great
ability, diligence, and proficiency in learning. He first
studied at the University of Placentia, and from thence he
was removed to Salamanca by Frederick the Second, King
of Castille. He here obtained a reputation so far above all
the other students as to induce Don Diego, Bishop of
Osuna, to select him as the most proper person to become
a canon in his church. Dominick was soon after appointed
by Don Alonzo, King of Castile, to accompany his ambassador
to the Court of France. On this journey the saint
first encountered some of the Albigenses, and to the extinction
of their heresy he chiefly devoted the remainder of his
life, by instituting his celebrated order of Dominican
Preaching Friars A.D. 1215, in imitation of the Franciscans,
established about six years before. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick
did not, however, implicitly rely on his own exertions, or
on those of his order, suited as it was to the ignorance and
abject slavery of those times; but called loudly to their aid
the secular arm, and established the Inquisition, so that after
thousands had been converted from their heresy, and tens
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pageno">312</span>
of thousands massacred, the conquerors enjoyed in the possession
of their plundered property the additional conscious
satisfaction of having freed the church from heretics so
audacious as to deny that wheaten<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_40" id="fnanchor_40"></a><a href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></span>
flour was entirely
changed into the body of Christ.</p>

<p>Dominick departed this life in the odour of sanctity on
the 6th of August 1221, having completed his fifty-first
year. Having performed various miracles, and even raised
people from the dead, he was canonised by Gregory <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> in
1234. Before the close of his short life, a great number of
houses were founded throughout Europe for his disciples,
and, faithful to the original object of the new order, he bequeathed
to their charge the Tribunal of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>The Dominicans and Franciscans for a long time supported
the power of Rome, according to the dream of Pope
Innocent <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in which he saw the Lateran Church in danger
of falling down, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick sustaining its weight. But
finally, the sale of indulgences, through the medium of this
order, excited the resentment or the envy of others, and
Friar Martin Luther, assisted by the growing genius of the
age, crumbled to pieces a spiritual authority, of which it was
fondly believed that destiny had said with more truth than
of its temporal predecessor,</p>

which. By this name the now parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick,
as aforesaid, was taxed in the Domesday Roll 20
William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, which place gave name and original to
an old family of gentlemen, surnamed De Halton, who
flourished here in gentle degree from the Norman Conquest
to the ninth year of Edward the Second, at which
time Joan, the only daughter and heir of Richard de Halton,
Lord also of the Manor of Hardfast, in this county,
was married to Robert Wendyn, of Compton Gifford, in
Devon, who had issue by Joan de Halton, one only daughter,
that became his heir, married to John Whiteleigh, of
Efford, in Devon, father of Richard Whiteleigh, Sheriff of
Devon 9 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> grandfather of Richard Whiteleigh,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Devon 6 Henry <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr> whose two daughters
and heirs were married to Roger Grenvill, of Stowe, and
Richard Hals, of Kenedon, from whom the writer of this
book is lineally descended. Of this family was John de
Halton, Bishop of Carlisle, who died 1318.</p>

<p>The 19th of Elizabeth, Anthony Rous, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> then Sheriff
of Cornwall, was possessed of this place; as was also his son
Anthony Rous, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 44th Elizabeth.
But &mdash;&mdash; Rous, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the last possessor of this barton, dying
without issue, as I take it, passed these lands to his widow
for payment of debts, who afterwards married &mdash;&mdash; Cossens,

<p>Crockaddon in this parish is the mansion house of James
Trevisa, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> descended from John Trevisa, born in this
place, as I am informed, and bred at Oxford. He became
a secular priest and chaplain to James Lord Berkeley, by
whom he was made vicar of Berkeley in Gloucestershire,
<!--352.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pageno">314</span>
and at his request he translated the Bible into English, although
the same had been done by John Wickliff fifty
years before, but not with that perfection of language that
Trevisa did it, although Trevisa’s translation fell as far
short of Tindall’s in Henry the Eighth’s days; by reason
the English language was still improving to a higher
pitch, for they all agreed in the original sense and meaning
of the text. Trevisa also translated Bartholomew de Proprietatibus
Rerum, the Polychronicon of Ralph Higden,
and divers other Treatises. He died a very aged man, about
1410, since which time the descendants of his family have
flourished in good fame in those parts.</p>

<p>Their arms are, Gules, a garb Or.</p>

<p>Pentilly is the mansion of Sir James Tilly, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> formerly
steward to Sir John Corington, who married first, a
daughter of Sir Henry Vane, and was afterwards knighted
by King James the Second. After this, having assumed
the arms of Count Tilly, of Germany, together with his supporters,
he had them taken from him, and was fined by the
kings at arms several hundreds for his presumption. This
occurrence gave rise to an unfounded story of his having
been degraded from his knighthood, for that he was not a
gentleman either of blood, arms, or descent; but it is clear
that a knight need not be a gentleman of blood, witness the
number at present that are not so. To his second wife he
married the widow of Sir John Corington, his former
master; she was one of the daughters of Sir Richard Chiverton,
of London; but he did not leave any remaining
issue by either of his wives. This Pentilly is a new name
given by himself to this his seat, from its situation on the
side of a steep hill, having a pleasant prospect of the river
Tamar, and of the country round about. He has adorned
it with fine new buildings, composed of several towers with
gilded balls, and several walks of lime-trees on the side of
the hill. All which together at a distance made a pretty
show, Sir James Tilly dying without issue, left his estate
and his house to his sister’s son, James Tilly Woolley, who,
<!--353.png--><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a><span class="pageno">315</span>
by the name of James Tilly, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is now, 1734, sheriff of

Domesday Book it is called Haltone; and it was one of

<p>I believe this parish does not derive its name from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dominic de Gusman, the first author of that barbarous tribunal
the Inquisition, the name being anterior to him;

<p>Mr. Lysons says that Francis Rous, distinguished as a
member of both houses during the Protectorate, was born
at Halton about the year 1579. He was made provost of
Eton College, and died at Acton, in Middlesex, in January
1659. The property now belongs to Mrs. Bluett, daughter
and heiress of Mr. John Clerk, in whose family were
this manor, and the advowson of the living.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons further states that Charles Fitz-Geoffry, rector
of this parish, where he died in 1637, published the Life
of Sir Francis Drake, written in lofty verse and when he
was only Bachelor of Arts, a Collection of Latin Verses, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Sir James Tillie appears to have been at the least an
eccentric man, from the fanciful directions which he gave
respecting his funeral. He was succeeded, as has been
stated, by his nephew, James Woolley, who took his
name; and the only daughter of this gentleman’s grandson
married the late Mr. John Coryton, of Crockadon, descended
by a female line from the Corytons of Newton.
Mr. Coryton was Sheriff of Cornwall in 1782. His son,

on Pentillie, and made it one of the finest seats in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Hals and Mr. Tonkin have reference to
Crockadon and Pentillie in the parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick,

<p>One Forbes, or Forbhas, was presented rector of this
parish in the latter end of Cromwell’s usurpation, and
lived here on this fat benefice, without spending or lending
any money, many years, always pretending want thereof; at
length he died suddenly intestate, about the year 1681,
having neither wife nor legitimate child, nor any relation of
his in blood in this kingdom; upon news of whose death Mr.
Arundell, his patron, opened his trunks, and found about
three thousand pounds in gold and silver, and carried it
thence to his own house. The fame and envy of which fact
flew suddenly abroad, so that Mr. Buller, of Morval, had
notice thereof, who claimed a part or share in this treasure,
upon pretence of a nuncupative will, wherein Forbes some
days before his death had made him his executor, and the
same was concerted into writing, whereupon he demanded
the 3,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> of Mr. Arundell. But he refusing to deliver the
same, Mr. Buller filed a bill in Chancery against him the
said Mr. Arundell, praying relief in the premises, and that
the said money might be brought or deposited in the said
court, which at length was accordingly done; where, after
long discussing this matter between the lawyers and clerks
in that court, in fine, as I was informed, the court, the
plaintiff, and the defendant shared the money amongst
them, without the least thanks to, or remembrance of the
deceased wretch Forbes for the same; abundantly verifying
that saying in the Sacred Writings, “man layeth up riches,
but knows not who shall gather them.”</p>

<p>Since the writing of the above, the incumbent, Mr.
Fincher, has built a pretty fine house on the glebe lands
of this vicarage, equal if not superior to any other of that
sort in Cornwall of its bigness, except Altar-nun, as designing
to buy the patronage thereof, being a sinecure,
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pageno">318</span>
which I interpret too often to be, without care, thought,
regard, or guardianship, over souls, where the rector presents
to the vicarage. But maugre all designs and endeavours
of Mr. Fincher to purchase the patronage of this
church, Sir John Seynt-aubyn and Mr. Arundell, the patrons
thereof, sold the same to Balliol College in Oxford
1701. At the consideration of which fact, as common fame
saith, Mr. Fincher was so dismayed, that forthwith he
grew melancholy, and the grief thereof so depressed his
spirits, that he broke his heart, and departed this life 26th
November 1703, at night; and so went to Heaven in that
great tempest and hurricane that then happened, with many
others. The vicar has now all the tithes, paying 40<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> yearly
to the master or one of the fellows of Balliol College, by act
of parliament. Properly he is the rector of a church, that
hath a parsonage where a vicarage is endowed, to which he
presents, as in this parish; and yet it is supposed, in some
places, that person is the patron, or he in whom the right
of patronage is; for before the second Council of Lateran,
A.D. 1131, he had right to the tithes, in regard of his having
endowed the church which he had founded. But the Council
of Lateran aforesaid, under Pope Innocent <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> consisting
of two thousand bishops, made it sacrilege and damnation
for laymen to take tithes.</p>

<p>Tre-wer-gy, id est, the village or farm-town, the same,
I suppose, in Domesday Roll, taxed by the name of Treworgan,
being still the voke lands of an ancient barton and
manor, which claims the royalty or liberty of fishing over
the river and haven of Loo, by virtue of the grant thereof
from the ancient Earls and Dukes of Cornwall in right of
their honour, manor, borough, and castle of Liskeard, situate
upon the same river, which place was the mansion
of the ancient, worshipful, and gentle family of the Kendalls
for many ages; and in particular here lived Richard
de Kendall, Sheriff of Cornwall 8 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1385, as his
posterity continued to do till John Kendall, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> having no
issue <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> and his estate being incumbered
<!--357.png--><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pageno">319</span>
with debt, sold this barton and manor to William Williams,
of Boderick, merchant, now in possession thereof. The
arms of Kendall are, Argent, a chevron between three dolphins
Sable. Ken-dall signifies to see or behold the dale
or valley; otherwise Kendall or Cendall is fine linen; and
Cen-dale may be a corruption of Pendall, id est, the head
of the valley.</p>

<p>Tremada in this parish signifies the extasy or transport
town, alias Tremodart, that is, the dart or javelin affliction
(as Cornish-English for hobel is a dart). This barton and
manor, as I am informed, was the dwelling of the Col-shills,
id est, neck-shields; so called from their wearing, in time of
battle, their shield or coat armour with a ribbon about their
neck, originally denominated from Colshill parish, in Arden
hundred, in Warwickshire. And in particular here lived
John Collshill, sheriff of Cornwall 16 <abbr title="Richard Two">Rich. II.</abbr> 1393; John
Collshill was sheriff of Cornwall 21 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>; John
Colshill was sheriff of Cornwall 17 Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>; John Collshill,
<abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> was sheriff of Cornwall 7 Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, whose issue
male dying, his inheritance fell amongst his two daughters,
married to Seyntaubyn and Arundell (a younger branch
of the Arundells of Trerice), now in possession thereof, that
married Kelland: his father Drew; and giveth the same
arms as the Arundells of Trerice. The lords of this manor
and barton of Tremadah, I suppose, founded and endowed
the vicarage and rectory church of Dulo. Perhaps the
Collshills, since their posterity aforesaid, have long been patrons
thereof. Their manor of Manley Collshill is in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Veepe. This gentleman is dead, and the family extinct.</p>

<p>West-north, or rather north-west, is the voke-lands of a
dismembered manor, formerly belonging to the Kendalls
of Treworgye, and was by one of them, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
given with his daughter in marriage with Kellyow; whose
only daughter and heir was married to &mdash;&mdash; Bastard, a
barrister-at-law, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Hen. <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> which brought this then
undivided manor into that family, who seated themselves
therein for several generations, till Sir William Bastard,

<!--358.png--><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a><span class="pageno">320</span>
of Cornwall, now in possession thereof. Bastard’s
arms are painted in several glass windows of this house,
together with divers matches or quarterings; whose arms
are, Or, a chevron Azure. The arms of Kellyow are,
Or, a chevron between two cinquefoils and a mullet Sable.</p>

<p>Trenant in this parish, id est, the valley-town, is the
seat of &mdash;&mdash; Medhop, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> whose father married Porter.
His grandfather, rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Martin’s by Looe; his great
grandfather, rector of the same parish; which gentlemen,
as I am informed, are lineally descended from the Mydhops
of Essex, some of whose ancestors gave lands in frank-almoine
to the Abbey of Furneaux there, 1290, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Roger
de Mydhop, son and heir of Henry de Mydhop, who gave
for his arms, Ermine, a lion rampant Azure, crowned Or.
See <span class="sc">Gwillim</span>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 195.</p>

<p>Tre-wenn, in this parish, id est, the white town, or
town-white, is the dwelling of William Dandy, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
attorney-at-law, that got a considerable estate in that profession.
Since the writing of the above this estate is much
impaired, and gone out of the direct to the collateral heir,
of the name of Dandy; which name signifies in Cornish,
deadly, cruel, mortal, fatal.</p>

parish, I cannot agree with Mr. Hals in supposing it God’s
Lake. I rather interpret it the Black Lake, alluding to the
river Looe, which runs through it, and I guess takes that
name from its forming a deep lake or pool between the two
towns and it when the tide is in.</p>

<p>The etymology of Dulo given by Mr. Tonkin appears to
be very probable; but another is quoted by Mr. Bond, in
his excellent work, entitled, “Topographical and Historical
Sketches of the Boroughs of East and West Looe, in
Cornwall,” printed by Nichols in 1828, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 48:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In Archbishop Usher’s work, Britannicarum Ecclesiarum
Antiquitates et Primordia, it appears that the church
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theliaus, in Wales, is called, Lhan Deilo Vaur,
the Church of Great Theliaus; and the change of Deilo to
Dulo is so easy, says a recent writer, that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theliaus seems
to have the best title to this parish, as patron and owner
of it. In confirmation of this conjecture, says the same writer,
we find in the barton of Treridern in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian a chapel
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dillo, who is indisputably the Theliaus.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Theliau, or Theliauses, was born at Ecclesis Gwenwau,
near Monmouth. He is said to have made a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem about the year 500, with <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paternus. On his return he became Bishop of Landaff,
and he has ever since been considered as the patron of that
diocese.</p>

<p>Trewargy, properly Tre-war-gie, the house or town on
a stream, is now the property of Mr. Eliot, a gentleman
resident in London.</p>

<p>Trenant has frequently changed its proprietors since the
time of Mr. Hals. It passed from Mr. Dennis to his
sister’s son, Sir Christopher Treise, who was Sheriff of
Cornwall at the accession of King George the Third, and
knighted on the occasion of presenting an address. The
property thus devolved on his nephew Sir John Morshead,
of Cartuther, who acquired a large fortune by his marriage,
succeeded to an ample patrimony, dissipated the whole,
and left the prefix of three letters as an inheritance to his
son. It was then purchased by Admiral Sir Edward Buller,
and again disposed of after his decease to Mr. Hope, who at
this instant, 1833, offers it for sale. Some at least of these
<!--360.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pageno">322</span>
changes have been ascribed to combinations and arrangements
which were materially varied in the last year.</p>

<p>The arms of these united towns are, King Arthur’s

mayor chosen annually by a jury out of the sworn free

Commons House of Parliament, elected by the freemen of

held in this county, by the tenure of knight service, five

<p>But that which made this place most famous was the
castle and palace of Dundagell, wherein in all probability,
the Kings, Dukes, or Earls of Cornwall, at some time had
their residence, for pleasure and safety, before Cæsar came
into this land; and for that it was the birthplace of Arthur
<!--362.png--><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a><span class="pageno">324</span>
King of Britain, of whom more under. The castle itself
stood on the sea cliff, and a high promontory of land or
island, shooting into the North Sea or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Channel,
fastened to the main land or insular continent of Britain,
by an iron chain and drawbridge, which Mr. Carew
saith was extant about 100 years before he wrote his Survey
of Cornwall 1602. Hence it was that in the Domesday
Tax, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087, it is called Dunecheine, as aforesaid,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the fort, fortress, or castle chain or chained.
Under which drawbridge the sea formerly did daily make
its flux and reflux, through the rocky passage beneath.
But now this passage is barred up by the falling down of
the contiguous cliffs, and want of repair; nevertheless,
thereby at low water is offered to the foot traveller an indifferent
way of access to the castle or island aforesaid. Which
island is now by lease from the crown in possession of Mr.
Travers, who sets it to rent for about 5<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, where
twice a year about thirty fat sheep are bred or fed, that
thrive to admiration.</p>

<p>The back or outer part of this fort or island, contains
about three acres of land, which affords good pasture for
sheep, goats, and rabbits, whereon is a consecrated well,
and chapel heretofore applied to the service of God, by
the Prince Gothlouis, his domestic servants and soldiers,
though now neglected and falling into continual decay.
The most northerly and remote part of this island is called
Pen-dew, or Pen-diu, that is to say black head, so named
from the black cliffs and rocks thereof; a well known seamark,
amongst mariners. The cliffs all round this island
and decayed castle are from the sea inaccessible, excepting
in one place on the east, where is an indifferent landing
place for boats; but the same is artificially barred with a
long lofty and strong wall of lime and stone, through which
was a gate, called in British, Porth Horne, Anglice Iron
Gate, leading to the hill. Under this island the sea runneth
through a natural cave or arch of rocks, where boats
may pass at full sea without danger, though scarcely without

horror and amazement of the passengers; which tremendous
place gave occasion to a British bard to describe
the same in verses, mentioned by Camden in his Britannia,

<p>From which words it is evident Joseph had seen Merlin’s
prophecy of King Arthur.</p>

<p>The History of King Arthur and his progenitors is this:</p>

<p>After the death of Ambrosius Aurelius, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 497,
succeeded to the dominion of Britain, some say his brother,
others a Britain named Uter, alias Uter Pen-dragon; that
is to say in British the terrible or dreadful head or chief
dragon, so called, as our historians tells us, from a direful,
bloody, or red dragon, pourtrayed in his banners of war
with a golden head, as is to this day borne in our imperial
standards of war, in memory doubtless of the red dragon
mentioned in Merlin’s Prophecy, by which the British nation
is figured. For his paternal coat armour, as Upton
saith, was, in a field Vert, a plain cross Argent; in the
dexter quarter the image of the blessed Virgin Mary, holding
the image of her blessed Son in her right hand, Proper.
He likewise gave for his cognizance of Britain, d’Or, deux
dragons Verd, coronés de Goules, contrelés, or endorsed.</p>

<p>Which prince, about the fourth year of his reign, having
had divers notable victories over his enemies the Saxons,
killing Pascentrus, the son of Hengist, and Gwellimoore
King of Ireland, taken Octa and another son of Hengist,
and Cossa, his nephew, prisoners, and routed their forces;
he resolved the Easter after to make a kind of triumphal
feast and solemnity for the principal nobility, gentry, and
soldiers, of his kingdom; and ordered likewise that their
wives and daughters should also be invited to his court, to
congratulate his victories against his Pagan enemies. Now
this feast was to be kept at Caer-Segont, id est, the city or
castle of conquest or victory, afterwards called, by the
Saxons, Cell-Cester, id est, Great Castle, now Winn-Chester,
as much as to say, the overcoming, conquering, or
winning castle, as before; the very place where the Emperor
<!--365.png--><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pageno">327</span>
Constantine first put on the purple robes, in order
to his dignity.</p>

<p>Amongst other princes and confederates that attended
this solemnity, Goth-lois, or Goth-Louis, id est, purple
back or spear, Prince, King, or Earl of Cornwall, with
Igerna, his lady, graced the same with their presence. And
it was observable that in this great assembly, the said lady,
for beauty, port, and mein, exceeded all other women then
present. With whose unparalleled demeanour and
charms, King Uter was so much taken and delighted, or
intoxicated rather, that for several days he omitted all other
most necessary affairs of his kingdom, in order to enjoy her
company. Yea, so violent was his affection, that he could
not restain or curb his passion, but kissed and courted her
openly, even in the sight of her lord and others. Whereupon
Gothlouis was so possessed with jealousy that he took
the first opportunity, without leave taken of the king or his
nobility, together with his duchess and servants, and posted
from Winchester, towards his own country of Devon and
Cornwall. He had not been long gone, but the notice
thereof was soon brought to the king, who took it in so ill
a part, by reason of his inordinate affection to his lady, that
forthwith he sent messengers after him, to let him know
that he had further occasion to use his counsel about affairs
of the nation.</p>

<p>But Gothlouis so highly prized his lady, who by this artifice
he foresaw would be exposed to the king’s attempts,
that he sent back positive answer that he would not come.
At which return the king grew more enraged, and sent the
Prince of Cornwall word, that if he persisted in his obstinacy,
he would invade his country, and beat his towns and
castles about his ears; but in vain were his menaces, for
Gothlouis returned him word that he was, as his predecessors
time out of mind had been, a free prince, and owed
him neither homage nor allegiance. Nevertheless, as his
countryman, he acknowledged himself his ally and confederate
against all foreign opposers, and would keep his
<!--366.png--><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pageno">328</span>
articles of agreement; but if Uter were not contented with
this answer, but would forcibly invade his country and property,
he would endeavour to keep and preserve the same
against him and his adherents. Whereupon King Uter
denounced hostility against him, and sent him defiance as
an enemy, and forthwith set all things in a posture of war
against him. Neither was Gothlouis less solicitous to keep
his country and duchess from Uter’s possession or indeed
vile usurpation.</p>

<p>In brief, therefore, as aforesaid, King Uter having raised
a great army of soldiers, under pretence of chastising the
pride and contempt of Gothlouis, marched with them towards
his territories, which extended as far as Axminster,
where he no sooner arrived than he falls a plundering the
country, and burning the houses of the inhabitants, with the
terror whereof some fled away, and others submitted to his
mercy. Gothlouis being then at his chief palace and castle
of Caer-Iske, id est, the Fish Castle or City, situate upon
the Fish River, now called Exe, as the City is Exeter,
and hearing of this affrightment and revolt of the people on
the east part of his dominions, and fearing the cowardice of
his citizens of Caer-Iske, he quitted the same upon Uter’s
approach with his army, and fled from thence with his lady,
and posted themselves in this castle of Dundagell, where he
left his duchess, himself retiring to Dameliock Castle, now
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> <a name="err23" id="err23"></a>Veye or
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Vewe, where his army lay entrenched
within a treble walled fortification of earth, still extant, and
retaining its name, wherein he had laid up sufficient provision
and ammunition for his camp and soldiers, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> And
there also he was promised to receive assistance of soldiers
from one of the five Kings of Ireland, which were daily
expected.</p>

<p>King Uter understanding of Gothlouis’ departure from
Caer-Iske, soon marched after him with his army into
Cornwall, and laid siege to the castle of Dameliock, that is
to say, the house or place of skirmish, battle, or hazard of
war, and no sooner approached the lines, but he sent an
<!--367.png--><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a><span class="pageno">329</span>
herald or trumpet to Gothlouis, demanding the surrender
of himself and castle on mercy. Gothlouis, rewarding the
trumpet, returned answer, “that he gave King Uter no
just cause of war, or for breaking the league or invading
his country, and wasting the same in such barbarous manner.
But especially, he being a free prince, neither could
nor would betray his trust, or give up his dominions and
subjects to an unjust invader.” At which answer King
Uter was so enraged, that he gave order for a straight siege
of the castle, and forthwith made many violent assaults by
storm in several places thereof; but he was as stoutly repulsed
and driven back by the besieged. In this manner,
with various success, for many days the siege and war continued,
which occasioned the many camps, fortifications,
and intrenchments in those parts, called Castle Kitty, Biny,
Castle Kynven, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Whereupon King Uter being more desirous to obtain
the Lady Igerna, than to shed blood, or take the fort of
Dameliock, thought of nothing more than how to get possession
of her. In order to which, he was so vain as to inquire
whether the said lady was within the said castle,
and whether she was in so good state of health as when he
saw her at Caersegant. To which questions answer was
made, that fame reported nothing to the contrary as to her
health, but for her person, that was not in Dameliock Castle,
but kept in a much more secure place, within the impregnable
fort of Dundagell. Then, inquiring further of a deserter
what manner of place that was, he was told it was a
castle munified by art and nature, and of so narrow entrance
over the sea and rocks by a drawbridge, that three armed
men at once would keep out his whole army, maugre all
their skill and strength. At the relation of which circumstances,
King Uter seemed mightily dismayed, so that his
countenance changed through anguish and perplexity of
mind, which put him into such great anxiety as was Ahab
for want of Naboth’s vineyard, David for Bathsheba, and
Nero for Sabina Popeia, other men’s wives.</p>

<p><!--368.png--><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pageno">330</span>
King Uter Pendragon, in this extremity, as not being
able to reduce Dameliock Castle by storm, nor, if he could,
would that redress his grief, by procuring the sight of
Igerna, resolves upon this expedient, to dislodge part of his
soldiers and troops from Dameliock, and march with them
to Dundagell, in order to try the fortune of war in both
places. But as soon as he came in sight thereof, the same
appeared more formidable, tremendous, and invincible,
than what report or fame had spoken of it. For in those
days the wit and force of man, could not oblige that castle
to a surrender, unless through bribery or treachery of its
defendants, for that the same could neither be scaled, battered,
or starved.</p>

<p>The consideration of which put Pendragon into greater
sadness and perplexity of mind, through the charge and fatigues
of war, the stain of his honour in these unsuccessful
attempts, but chiefly for that he could not obtain the fair
Igerna; whereupon he grew sickly and took his bed, his
physicians despairing of his life. When it happened, as
historians tell us, that one Ursan, of Richardock, a place
near Dameliock or Dundagall, one of King Uter’s cabinet
council, advised him to send into Wales, for the old British
prophet Merlin, and try whether he could do that by his
magic art which neither the art or courage of men of war
could effect; whereupon Pendragon sent for the prophet,
who when arrived to his camp was made acquainted with
the premises, and immediately bid the king to be of good
comfort, for that he doubted not but in short time he would
introduce him to the company of Igerna, without further
bloodshed or hostility.</p>

<p>The king gladly heard this discourse, and promised to
follow any expedient he should prescribe, in order to obtain
the lady; and further assured him of a great reward,
in case his project succeeded. Whereupon Merlin ordered
the king, together with Ursan, of Richardock, to attend
him one night in the twilight, with whom in secret manner
he went towards the drawbridge gate of Dundagell Castle,
<!--369.png--><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a><span class="pageno">331</span>
where, making a noise, the sentinel or porter demanded in
the dark who they were? Merlin being transformed into
the shape of Bricot, a servant that waited on Gothlouis,
and lay in his chamber, made answer that his master, Duke
Gothlouis, escaped from the siege of Dameliock, was at the
gate for entrance. The porter apprehending he heard the
very voice of Bricot, and seeing at some distance two persons
talking together, the one King Uter metamorphosed
into the shape of Duke Gothlouis, and another, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Ursan,
of Richardock, transformed into the shape of Jordan, of
Dundagell, he let down the drawbridge, and so gave them
opportunity to enter into the insular castle aforesaid, where
he had further confirmation of the identity or reality of their
persons, by their speech and apparel, as far as the night
would permit him.</p>

<p>Whereupon he forthwith joyfully conducted King Uter
to Igerna’s chamber, who, not discovering the fraud, gladly
received him as her lord; when that very night was begotten
that valiant, noble, and religious Prince Arthur, who
for his brave, facinourous, and heroic achievements, made
his name glorious in his days, as it is still the paragon
of ours.</p>

<p>Now on that same night his soldiers were so careful and
valiant in the siege of Dameliock Castle, that they stormed
it with their scaling ladders, but were as stoutly driven back
by the besieged; whereupon, Duke Gothlouis resolved no
longer to be thus cooped up, or confined in walls or
trenches, but either to conquer or die, and the next morning
sallied forth with a party of soldiers, and assaulted his enemies
in their quarters by surprize: but alas! the success was
not answerable to his courage and resolution, for King
Uter’s men were all in readiness to receive his charge and
onset, so that in the brunt of the first encounter Gothlouis
was killed on the spot, his party slain or routed, and all that
were taken in arms put to the sword. The castle of Dameliock
yielded on condition of life, though some say otherwise,
the plunder to the king’s soldiers.</p>

<p><!--370.png--><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a><span class="pageno">332</span>
Early on the same morning, before King Uter and the
duchess were out of their chamber, or had on their
wearing apparel, to the great astonishment of the porter,
centinel, and the garrison, a messenger arrived at Dundagell
Castle, giving a full account of the tragical fact. But
when he was admitted to the Duchess’s bedchamber, and
saw, as he verily believed, Duke Gothlouis in her company,
he could hardly credit his own report; especially the
Duchess Igerna being of the same opinion. But then,
alas! so unavoidable a thing is fortune or fate, the prophet
Merlin began to uncharm and dissolve his former spells
and incantations, so that King Uter appeared no longer as
Gothlouis Duke of Cornwall, but sole monarch of Britain;
his companion, not Jordan of Dundagell, but Ursan of
Richardock; and the third, not Bricot, but Merlin the prophet,
to the great admiration of all spectators.</p>

<p>Whereupon the king took leave of the Duchess, and
posted to his army, then in possession of Dameliock Castle,
and ordered search to be made for the dead body of the
duke; where at length it was found in common soldier’s apparel,
extreme bloody, mangled, and cut. Whereupon he
called an embalmer, who forthwith embalmed the body with
salt and aromatic spices, to prevent putrefaction till a military
interment could be prepared for him, which a month
after was splendidly provided, the King and Duchess
being chief mourners; when, a few days after, King Uter
publicly married Igerna the duchess, by whom as aforesaid
he had a son named Arthur and a daughter named Amye.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is observed by our annalists upon the foregoing
history, that after this bloody war, and unjust fact of King
Uter’s, he never had any tolerable success against his Saxon
enemies; but in many battles was worsted by them, and
finally, some of them understanding of a good spring or
well of water, whereof he usually drank, they secretly envenomed
the same, so that afterwards the king, drinking his
customary draught thereof, soon after, with intolerable pains,
died in the fifteenth year of his reign, and the flower of his
<!--371.png--><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a><span class="pageno">333</span>
age, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 515, fulfilling that saying in the Sacred
Writings, “The same measure that ye mete shall be measured
to you again, brimfull and running over.” So that I
shall conclude this history in the words of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, “O
the height of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How
unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding
out!”</p>

<p>After the death of King Uter Pendragon, his son and
heir Arthur, begotten as aforesaid, succeeded to his dominion
of Britain, anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 515, but as others say 518.
He is therefore rightly named by some authors, Arthur Mab
Uter Pendragon, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> Arthur, the son of Uter Pendragon.
Which name Arthur is probably derived from the British
Arthou, a good or sharp pointed weapon. Of this King
Arthur, long before his birth, had Merlin prophecied to
King Vortigern:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Aper etenim Cornubiæ succursum præstabit [si non
potius erit] et colla eorum sub pedibus suis conculcabit,
insulæ oceani potestati ipsius subdentur; et Galicanos
saltus possidebit; tremebit Romulea Domus sevitiam ipsius;
et exitus ejus dubius erit; in ore populorum cœlebrabitur,
et actus ejus cibus erit narrantibus. Sex posteri ejus
tenebunt sceptrum,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>Which in English amounts to this:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“That the boar of Cornwall shall bring aid and assistance,
and shall tread the necks of our enemies under his
feet, the islands of the ocean shall be subject to his power,
and the Gaulish forests he shall possess, the house of Romulus
shall tremble at his wrath. As for his death or end,
it shall be doubtful or uncertain. His name shall be celebrated
by the people, and his famous acts shall be food to
those that do relate them. Six of his lineage shall sway the
sceptre,” <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p>King Arthur no sooner succeeded to his father’s dominions
but he applied himself with great piety and religion
to administer law and justice to his people, the best expedients
to establish a tottering sceptre. In the next place
<!--372.png--><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a><span class="pageno">334</span>
he took care to fortify and strengthen himself with soldiers
and arms against his Saxon enemies, a mighty and warlike
people, then possessed of the greatest part of this kingdom
by the late misfortunes of his father and other princes, in
battle with them, so that only Wiltshire, Devon, Dorset,
Cornwall, and Wales, made up his dominion. Against
these King Arthur drew into the field a mighty army of
soldiers, and after eleven pitched battles against them, overthrew
their whole armies, and obtained the total dominion
of this kingdom, and confined the Saxons, on condition of
tribute and submission, only to the kingdom of Kent. And
recorded it is by annalists, that in one of those battles which
King Arthur had with them, he girded himself with an approved
sword, called Callib-burne, with which in one day
he slew with his own hands 800 Saxons. It seems, this
weapon was like Goliah’s sword wrapped in the ephod,
there was no sword like it. And thus, according to Merlin’s
prophecy, did the boar of Cornwall bring help and
assistance, and tread Britain’s enemies under his feet.</p>

<p>But no sooner was this land settled in peace at home, but
plots and designs from abroad were laid to disturb the tranquillity
thereof. For at that time the Romans, having
made a peace with their enemies the Vandals, sent messengers
to King Arthur, demanding 3,000<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum
tribute, a prodigious sum in those days, many years in
arrear, according to the agreement Julius Cæsar made with
King Cassibellan, and was still due to the senate. At which
demand King Arthur was so distasted, that he sent away
the messengers in scorn, and prohibited any Romans ever
after to come into this land upon that account. Especially
for that the Romans for many years had voluntarily quitted
or forsaken the government thereof, so that the Britains
had neither their protection nor aid against their Saxon or
other enemies. When these messengers returned to Rome,
this contempt of King Arthur was resented by the Senate,
who thereupon unanimously voted a war against him. And
accordingly a great army was raised in order to conquer
<!--373.png--><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a><span class="pageno">335</span>
and reduce this land, which arrived here under conduct of
Lucius, their prince or emperor, as historians tell us, together
with ten kings, his confederates and auxiliaries.
Against these king Arthur advanced with a mighty host,
and gave them battle, where, after a sharp and bloody conflict,
the Roman Emperor Lucius was slain, his body afterwards
sent to Rome, the whole Roman army routed, and
the greatest part of them put to the sword, and those whose
lives he spared he made his feodors and vassals.</p>

<p>But, alas! notwithstanding King Arthur’s good fortune
in this island against the Romans, he was not contented
therewith, but he resolved to be further revenged upon
them for his wrongs, bloodshed, and indignity, and for prevention
of any such invasion for the future, to make a descent
with his army upon the Roman territories in Gaul,
especially for that from thence the Romans were assisted
with great numbers of soldiers, under Lucius, to invade his
kingdom of Britain. Whereupon King Arthur, with a
considerable fleet of ships, and a great army of soldiers,
landed in Normandy, then called Neustria, and summoned
the people either to come and submit to his sceptre, or give
him battle. But they, confiding in the strength of the Roman
legions in that country, slighted his offer, and gave him
battle, in which contest they were totally overthrown,
routed, or slain. So that, soon after the province of Normandy
submitted to his mercy, cast down armour, and
payed tribute. Whereupon he gave to Gaius his taster, the
earldom of Andegavia, now Angieurs; and to Bedeverus,
his cupbearer, the dukedom of Normandy, for their good
services. In memory of which donations, it grew to a custom
amongst the kings of France, for many ages after, to
make their tasters and cupbearers Earls of Andegavia and
Normandy.</p>

<p>After this victory King Arthur dislodged his forces, and
advanced further into the Roman Gaulish provinces, and
subdued by conquest to his sceptre Flanders, Burgundy,
Aquitain, and Andegavia, and as some tell us afterwards
<!--374.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pageno">336</span>
Poland, and obliged those people to pay him an annual
tribute according; as Merlin had predicted of him, that the
Gaulish forests he should possess, and that the house of Romulus
should tremble at his wrath. After those victories he
returned safe into Britain, and then also by his fleet and
army reduced to his dominion, Scotland, Ireland, Iceland,
Gothland, Norway, Dacia, and made them all tributary,
which also was foretold by Merlin in those words, “the
islands of the ocean shall be subject to his power.”</p>

<p>When, after he had established peace in all those lands,
and returned into Britain, he instituted an honourable order
of knighthood, called the Knights of the Round Table, the
most antient order of knighthood in the world, chiefly to
promote self-denial, and prevent differences amongst his
nobility and gentry or soldiers, who had well deserved of
him and his country, for their good services at home and
abroad, that so no occasion of dispute might arise about precedence,
in merit, antiquity, valour, wealth, honour, or nobility,
amongst them, for that all the knights of this his order
were alike equal in those respects in his esteem, and might
sit down indifferently at the table, go in and out of the
house or church, field, or market, before each other as they
came without exception; being an allowed rule amongst
them, that the highest seat at the court, senate, church, or
table, did no more argue the worth, value, religion, valour,
or prudent conduct of a man, than the precedence of a military
officer did prove him more valiant than his soldiers.
The place of meetings of those knights was at Winchester
aforesaid, where they assembled yearly at Pentecost or
Whitsuntide.</p>

<p>He gave the same religious Christian coat armour as was
given by his father, which I have blazoned before; and in
testimony of his thirteen victories over so many crowned
heads, he bore also in a field Azure, thirteen imperial
crowns Or, as Upton tells us.</p>

<p>Lastly, after this prince had thus vanquished his enemies
abroad and at home, had restored the Christian Religion,
<!--375.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pageno">337</span>
eclipsed by the Saxons, ordained this useful order of knighthood,
and done all the good offices a just, pious, and religious
king could do to his subjects, he was at last, as many
others, ungratefully dealt with by his own people, who at
the instigation of his discontented cousin Mordred on the
Roman Pictish title, confederated with the Saxons as
against a bastard, and rose a great army in Cornwall in opposition
to his power; against whom King Arthur marched
with his army, and gave them battle at a place near Camelford.
Where, though he obtained the victory, and Mordred
was slain, yet in that battle King Arthur received his
mortal wounds, so that, soon after, in order to a cure, he
retired to the vale of Avallan, id est, the apple valley, near
Glastonbury, Somerset, where he lies buried.</p>

<p>King Arthur’s usual place of residence, where he kept
his court (as Hennius the Briton tells us, who flourished
anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 600), was at East or West Camellot, near Cadbury,
in Wiltshire.</p>

<p>There was extant in the Welsh tongue in bard’s verses
1170, <abbr title="tempore Henry Two">temp. Hen. II.</abbr> a song which said that the body of
King Arthur was buried at the Isle of Avallan, near Glastonbury,
between two pyramids. Whereupon King Henry
ordered search to be made after his corpse, as that most
classical and authentic author Giraldus Cambrensis, who
was an eye witness thereof saith, who relates, that after the
pioneers had sunk about seven foot deep, they lighted upon
a stone in form of a cross, to the back part thereof was fastened
a rude leaden cross, something broad, with those letters
inscribed: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Hic jacet sepultus inclitus Rex Arturius
in Insula Avalonia.”</span></p>

<p>Two feet beneath this cross they then also found two
coffins made of hollow oak, wherein were the bones and
skeletons of King Arthur and of Genevour his wife, the
hair of the said lady being then whole and of fresh colour,
as Fabian saith, but as soon as touched it fell to powder.

<p>King Arthur also, by reason of the great schism in the
Church between the Arian and Catholic Clergy, instituted
the order of Knights of the Holy Trinity, and built the
Chapel of Trinity at Restormell.</p>

<p>Pierce Gaveston being made Earl of Cornwall by King
Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and afterwards banished for his wicked practices,
and put to death by licence of that king, took out of
the jewel house a table of gold, and tressells of the same,
that once belonged to King Arthur, and delivered them to
Amery of Friscoband, a merchant, to be carried into Gascoigne,
where they were sold at a great price to his own
private advantage, as our chronologers tell us.</p>

But in memory of King Arthur, Roger Mortimer soon
after, at such time as he and Queen Eleanor his concubine,
wife of Edward the Second, governed this kingdom, in imitation
of him, kept a round table, to which many noble knights
belonged and frequented, to his infinite cost and expense,
which by him were called the Knights of the Round Table.

<p>I shall offer a conjecture touching the name of this
place, which I will not say is right but only probable. Tin
is the same as Din, Dinas; and Dixeth, deceit; so that
Tindixeth turned for the easier pronunciation to Tintagel,
Dindagel, or Daundagel, signifies the Castle of Deceit,
which name might be aptly given to it from the famous deceit
practised here by Uter Pendragon, by the help of
Merlin’s enchantment.</p>

<p>The manor of Tintagel was very antiently demesne land
of the crown, and famous for its castle, and Browne Willis
says, the castle, manor, and borough of Tintagel, were
settled by Edward the Third on his son Prince Edward,
whom he created Duke of Cornwall, and continued it to his
heirs, the succeeding Dukes of Cornwall, before which this
king’s brother, John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall, held it.
This castle boasts much greater antiquity, and is said to
have been the seat of the Dukes of Cornwall, and pretends
to have been the birthplace of the famous King Arthur,
which happened above five hundred years before the Norman
Conquest, that prince having been born in the year
500, fifteen years after which he is said to have succeeded
<!--378.png--><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a><span class="pageno">340</span>
his father in the kingdom, and to have lost his life in the
thirty-sixth year of his reign in a place near Camelford.
The borough of Bossiney, known in this county by the name
of Tintagel, is a very small village, and contains scarcely
twenty houses, and those not better than cottages. This
place, with Trevenna, another little hamlet equally mean,
lie in the parish of Tintagel, from which church they are
at no great distance, and with it make up the one borough.
It was privileged by Richard Earl of Cornwall and King
of the Romans, who granted “Quod Burgus noster de
Tyntaivil sit liber Burgus.” It is governed by a mayor.
The first return of Members to serve in Parliament is in
the reign of Edward the Sixth.</p>

<p>In an indenture during the reign of Queen Mary it is
styled Trevenna alias Bossiney, in others Trevenna simply,
in others Bossiney alone.</p>

<p>The borough is held from the duchy at a fee-farm rent of
11<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons says, “this castle, which is of great antiquity,
is reported to have been the birthplace of King Arthur,
with respect to whom it was the opinion of Lord
Chancellor Bacon, ‘that there was truth enough in his
story to make him famous, besides that which was fabulous.’
His history nevertheless has been so blended with the marvellous
by the monkish historians, that some authors have
been disposed to doubt of his existence; and the circumstances
connected with his supposed birth at Tintagel, are
clearly not among those parts of his story most entitled to
credit. We find no mention of this castle in authentic history
till the year 1245, when Richard Earl of Cornwall
was accused of having offered an asylum at his castle of Tintagel,
to his nephew David Prince of Wales, in rebellion
against his uncle Henry the Third. Thomas de la Hyde
was governor or constable of the castle in 1307, Thomas
<!--379.png--><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a><span class="pageno">341</span>
le Arcedekne in 1313, and William de Botreaux in
1325. It appears by a survey taken about that time, that
the castle was in a very ruinous state. The great hall was
taken down by John of Eltham. John Holland, Earl of
Huntingdon, was made constable in 1388.” Mr. Carew
states, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 286 Lord Dunstanville’s Edition, “that being
turned from a palace to a prison, this castle restrained one
John Northampton’s liberty, who for abusing the same in
his unruly mayoralty of London, was condemned hither as
a perpetual penitentiary,” and Thomas Earl of Warwick
was also a prisoner there in 1397.</p>

<p>Lord Treasurer Burleigh abolished the office of constable
or governor of this castle.</p>

<p>Norden has a print, accompanied by a description of the
castle, as it remained in his time, about 1584, when considerable
portions of the fortress appear to have remained
both on the island and on the main land.</p>

<p>The living belonged to the Great Benedictine Monastery
at Fontevrault in Anjou, distinguished by the peculiarity of
being presided over by an abbess, although the establishment
consisted of monks as well as nuns. Having been
seized into the king’s hands with other benefices belonging
to alien houses, this parish was given by Edward the Fourth
to the collegiate church of Windsor, where the great tithes
and the patronage of the living still remain.</p>

<p>It is stated by Doctor Borlase, that besides the chapel
within the fortress, dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ulette or Uliane, two
others existed in the parish, one dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tiron and
the other to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dennis.</p>

<p>I have retained the fabulous history of the Great Arthur,
with feelings similar to those which induced the Greeks to
dwell on the twelve labours of their Hercules, or the Scandinavians
to recount the exploits of Odin. In a manner
similar to what took place with respect to them, there
exist reasons for conjecturing, at least that a mythological
personage of remote antiquity became blended with a
<!--380.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pageno">342</span>
British warrior who opposed the Saxons, and that the constellation
Arcturus is in this way connected with the
Cornish chief.</p>

<p>The tales translated from the Celtic by Jeffery of Monmouth,
Bishop of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Asaph in 1152, are followed by the
author from whom Mr. Hals collected his materials; they
are also copied into the romance of Prince Arthur, where
in Caxton’s edition is a print of the king sitting in the
middle of his round table, with the knights companions surrounding
its circle. And this print has evidently given origin
to the lines of our most facetious poet, proving from the
round table that knight errants were accustomed to eat like
other persons. See part <span class="muchsmaller"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></span> canto 1, line 387.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals says this is the place called <a name="err24" id="err24"></a>Donecheniv in
Domesday Survey. Dunechine, would mean the fortress
or a chasm, corresponding precisely with the situation.</p>

<p>Joseph of Exeter, from whom Mr. Hals has translated
some lines on this place, is mentioned with great commendation
in Warton’s History of English Poetry: “But a
miracle of this age in classical composition was Joseph of
Exeter, commonly called Josephus Iscanus. He wrote two
epic poems in Latin heroic verse. The first is on the Trojan
War; it is in six books, and dedicated to Baldwin
Archbishop of Canterbury. The second is entitled Antiocheis,
The War of Antioch, or the Crusade. The
former is preserved; but a fragment only remains of the
latter, found in the library of Abingdon Abbey.”</p>

<p>In the retreat of Gothlouis before Uter Pendragon, Mr.
Hals mentions Exeter under the name of Caer Iske, but
without much commendation of the martial spirit possessed
by its inhabitants. If either Iske is the proper name
of this river, or the general term for a river has been
changed into Ex, the Celtic name will exactly accord with
the present Ex-cester, as the word is still pronounced in
Devonshire, the camp or fortress on the Ex.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>This parish offers many objects of considerable interest
to the geologist. It is entirely situated on rocks belonging
to the calcareous series. In the southern part, its rocks
consist of clay slates possessing various degrees of fissibility,
from the most perfect roofing-slate of Delabole, to a slate
that can only be separated into thick flags. Amongst these
strata occurs an interesting rock, which appears to be composed
of hornblende and compact felspar, and in some
parts of hornblende and calcareous spar only. The latter
variety is well known in the neighbourhood under the
name of green freestone, and may be seen in the walls of
the oldest churches. It is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in situ</i> in a croft near the pretty
little waterfall of Nathan’s or Kneighton’s Kieve.</p>

<p>In the northern part of the parish, near King Arthur’s
Castle, and in Bossiney Cove, the slate is very <dfn>talcose</dfn>,
and is occasionally coated at its joints with calcareous
spar. At the former place also occurs a large mass of
compact felspar, but which is so much decomposed that its
precise nature has not been ascertained. In the sea-cliffs
are several slate-quarries, the quality of which, however,
is inferior to the Delabole, and is known in the market by
the name of <dfn>cliff slate</dfn>. In this slate are impressions apparently
derived from shells, which have been referred to the
genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">producta</i>. This is the only instance of a fossiliferous
slate hitherto detected in Cornwall, though it is probable
that others may exist, particularly between <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> German’s
and the Rame Head.</p>

Trewinerder, id est, the high, haughty, beloved town, alias
Trewinar, id est, the town of the beloved lake or river of
water, on which those lands are situate, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> the Hayle River,
gave name and origin to an old family of gentlemen surnamed
De Trewinard, who flourished here for many generations
in genteel degree down to the latter end of the reign of
King Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> at which time John Trewinard, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was
Member of Parliament for the borough of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and so
became privileged against his creditors, being a man much
encumbered with debts, who during the intervals of parliament
kept house here and stood upon his guard, at which
time one of his creditors obtained judgment and outlawry
against him, after three terms in the county court, broke his
<!--383.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pageno">345</span>
house, took his person, and carried him prisoner to the
sheriff’s ward, where he remained till the next session of
parliament, against which time he brought his writ of habeas
corpus, and was brought up to Westminster in expectation
of great damages against his creditor that put him in durance.
Upon this restraint of Mr. Trewinard’s person, the
house resolved not to sit, looking upon it as a breach of
privilege, but entered before their rising into a grand committee
for hearing this case pro and con, betwixt Trewinard
and his creditor, when it appeared as aforesaid Trewinard
was outlawed and so out of the king’s protection, and till
that outlawry was reversed he could not lawfully sit as a
member; by which expedient Trewinard was forced to compound
with his creditor and sue forth the king’s pardon,
and then appeared in parliament in statu quo prius. This
John Trewinard had, as I take it, issue Martin Trewinard,
steward of the stannaries, who had issue Deiphobus Trewinard,
that in his rage or anger killed an innocent man
and buried him secretly in Trewinard Chapel, of public use
before the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth was erected; however, this
fact was not so covertly carried, but the coroners of the
shire had notice of it, who accordingly came to this place,
opened the grave, took forth the body, and impannelled a
jury thereon, who upon oath gave their verdict, that this
party’s death happened by a wilful murder of Trewinard’s,
whereupon he was carried before a justice of the peace, and
upon further examination of this matter, had his mittimus
made, and was accordingly sent to Launceston gaol, where
he remained till the next assizes.</p>

<p>In the mean time, foreseeing that this barbarous fact
would tend both to the destruction of his life and estate, he
applied to Sir Reginald Mohun, Knight, a favourite of the
Queen Elizabeth’s, and proposed to him, that he would
make over and convey to him, his heirs, and assigns for ever,
all his lands and tenements whatsoever, under this proviso
or condition, that in case he were condemned for the murder
aforesaid, that he should or would procure the Queen’s
<!--384.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pageno">346</span>
pardon or reprieve for his life; which proposal being accepted
by Sir Reginald Mohun, lease and release of his
lands were made and executed for a valuable consideration
accordingly to him, bearing date the day before this tragical
fact was committed, whereupon Sir Reginald Mohun forthwith
became seised of this barton and manor of Trewinard,
and at the next assizes held for this county, Mr. Trewinard
being indicted for this murder, was found guilty by the
grand and petty juries, and accordingly condemned to be
hanged to death, at which instant Sir Reginald Mohun
having gotten the Queen’s reprieve or pardon for Mr. Trewinard,
put it into the sheriff’s hands, whereby his execution
was stopped, and himself afterwards, on sureties for his
good behaviour, was set at liberty from the gaol, and subsisted
upon some small stipend allowed him by Sir Reginald
out of his lands during life.</p>

<p>The arms of Trewinard are yet extant in the glass windows
of this house, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> in a field Argent, a fess Azure, between
three Cornish daws Proper. Sir Reginald Mohun
took such pleasure in this place, that at some times he lived
on it in the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, and finally
settled it upon his three daughters, one of whom was married
to Sir Thomas Arundell, of Talvorne, Knight.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Arundell’s part of the premises was purchased
by Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongallan, Knight, who
having leases of the other two parts, some time also for pleasure
resided on this barton, whose son and heir John Hals
sold the same.</p>

<p>The present possessor of one third part in fee, and two
third parts in lease of this barton and manor, from Praed
and Penrose, as I take it, is Thomas Hawkins, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who
giveth for his arms the same bearing as Mr. Hawkins, of
Creed.</p>

<p>Such another tragical story of murder is to be seen under
Falmouth district, as also in Prince’s Worthies of Devon,
how that Sir John Prideaux, of Orchardton, killed in a duel
Sir William Bigberry, of Bigberry, Knight, whose ancestors
<!--385.png--><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a><span class="pageno">347</span>
from the Norman Conquest had lived there, in worshipful
degree, for nine descents, to the year 1360, when
the two daughters and heirs of this murdered gentleman
were married to Champernowne, of Beer Ferries, and
Durneford, of Stonehouse. By this misfortune Prideaux
being condemned to be hanged, gave most of his estate to
obtain his pardon from Edward the Third.</p>

<p>In like manner he tells us that Sir Alexander Cruwys,
<abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> slew one Mr. Carew, and for that
fact was condemned to be hanged, but in order to procure
his reprieve or pardon, he sold twenty-two manors of land.
Also that John Copleston, of Copleston, in Devon, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
commonly called the Great Copleston, in the middle of
Queen Elizabeth’s reign, in a rage slew his natural son and
godson, for which fact he was condemned to the gallows,
but in order to procure a reprieve or pardon, he was forced
to sell thirteen manors of land in Cornwall. His son left
only two daughters that became his heirs, married to &mdash;&mdash;
Copleston and &mdash;&mdash; Elford.</p>

<p>Lastly, he further tells us that Sir John Fitz, of Fitzford,
Knight, slew in a rage one Mr. Slannen, in the time
of Queen Elizabeth, after which fact, posting away to London,
with his servant, in order to get his pardon, and at
every stage shutting his chamber door, for fear of being
taken where he lodged, it happened in the night that his
servant knocking violently at his chamber door with some
intelligence, and he not well awaked out of his sleep, or not
well understanding his servant’s voice in the dark, he rushed
to the door, shot off a pistol, and slew his own servant,
which as soon as he understood, he took another pistol and
shot himself dead also.</p>

<p>Trenhayle, in this parish, that is to say, the stout, strong,
or rapid river, gave name and original to an old family of
gentlemen, from thence denominated Trenhayle, whose

as Tencreek’s daughter and heir, by her was married

whom he had Thomas Budeoxhed, Sheriff of Devon, 26
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> whose son married Pomeray, his grandson Trevilload,
his great-grandson Halwell, and his posterity successively
Stroote, Trowse, and Champernowne, which last
gentleman, Philip Budeoxhed, having no issue male or
female, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Elizabeth, his sisters became his heirs, and
were married, Winifred to Sir William Gorges, Elizabeth
to John Amadis, of Plymouth, Agnes to Oliver Hill, of
Shilston. Gorges sold Budeoxhed, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> to
Mr. Trevill, a merchant of Plymouth, now in possession
thereof. The arms of Budeoxhed are, Sable, three fusils
in fess between three bucks’ heads caboshed Argent.</p>

<p>Mr. Budeoxhed, aforesaid, Sheriff of Devon 26 Henry
<abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> at his own proper cost and charge, pulled down the old
church of Budeoxhed, and built the new church of Budeox,
as it now stands, wherein himself lies interred, some time
after his eldest daughter died, who was the first person that
was buried therein after the same was built and consecrated.

in some contest, to kill or murder a man there, he forthwith
made his escape thence, and fled into Ireland, where he remained
undiscovered for several years, at length returned
into his native country, and fixed in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth church

town, where he set up a painter’s shop, and surnamed
himself Paynter, from whom those gentlemen so called are
lineally descended. The present possessor Francis Paynter,

and was appropriated to the Church of Exeter,
to which it still belongs. As for the present name,
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, I take it to be a contraction of Sancta Hierytha,
of whom Camden, in Devon, speaks thus: “Chettlehampton,
a little village where Hierytha, calendered among the
female saints, was buried.”</p>

<p>Trewinard, in this parish, was of old the seat of a well regarded
family of gentlemen, from thence denominated De
Trewinard. It is now in the possession of Thomas Hawkins,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney at law, that married, first, the
daughter of James Praed, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; and secondly, Anne, the
daughter of Christopher Bellot, of Bochim, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> By the
first he has only one daughter, but by the second a numerous
issue. He giveth for his arms, in a field Argent, a
saltire Sable, charged with five fleurs-de-lis Or.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawkins owns but a third part of the mansion and
<!--388.png--><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a><span class="pageno">350</span>
barton of Trewinard, of which Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubin, and Mr.
James Praed, are joint lords with him. Mr. Thomas Hawkins
is since dead; and this is now the seat of his son
Christopher Hawkins, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and Clerk of the Assizes. He
hath married Mary, one of the daughters of Philip Hawkins,
of Pennance, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>I take the etymology of this name, Trewinard, to be a
town or dwelling on a marsh.</p>

<p>The Trewinards lived here probably before the Norman
Conquest, and were once possessed of an estate worth at the
least three thousand pounds per annum, as I have been informed
by one of their descendants, the late <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr.
James Trewinard, Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawgor in Meneage.</p>

<p>James De Trewinard was one of the Knights of the Shire
for Cornwall 20 Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> William De Trewinard was
so likewise in the 28th year of this reign.</p>

<p>Martin De Trewinard, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> (whom Mr. Carew calls a
merry Cornish gentleman, and tells a comical story of) I
believe was the last of them that possessed this estate, for
Norden, who wrote his description of Cornwall towards the
latter end of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, saith, that Trewinard
was the seat of Mannering.</p>

<p>Trelisick, compounded of Tre-lis-ick, a dwelling on the
broad creek, suitable to its situation on that part of the
river Hayle, where it openeth itself into a lake, is the seat
of the ancient family of Painter. The present owner of
which is Francis Painter, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> formerly one of the Clerks
of the Admiralty, and now General Receiver of the Prize
Money which shall become due to captors. He married a
daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Sutherland, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> late one of the Clerks
of the Admiralty, by whom he has only one surviving son
Mr. James Painter. His arms are, Azure, three slabs of
tin Argent, each charged with an annulet Sable.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Painter is since dead, leaving two daughters
by his second wife, a daughter of his uncle Mr. Francis
Painter, of Boskina in Burian. William Painter, D.D.
Rector of Exeter College in Oxford, was also a brother of
his father Arthur Painter.</p>

<p><!--389.png--><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a><span class="pageno">351</span>
&mdash;&mdash; Painter, of Antron, was, I am informed, a younger
branch of this family, and arrived at considerable eminence,
but, like many branches, it has withered, while the parent
stock remains fair and flourishing. But the family of Trelisick
is now extinct in the male line, by the death of Mr.
Francis Painter, <abbr title="junior">jun.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, now invariably written without the a, is supposed
to derive its name from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ergan, one of the female
missionaries from Ireland.</p>

<p>The church stands at the side of what must have been an
estuary in former times, pretty much like Egleshayle, near
Wadebridge. The church is neat and plain, with three
ailes of equal height, the roof has wooden ribs with bosses,
and the whole was plastered about the year 1747. The
tower is not inferior to most others, and the south porch is
remarkable for its beauty. The whole eastern extremity of
the south aile is said to have belonged exclusively to Trewinnard,
but for want of asserting it, the right has been
lost.</p>

<p>The walls of the church were covered with sentences, and
the windows were ornamented by stained glass, but in the
great repair bestowed on the church in 1747, all these were
removed, as it is said, by the zeal of Mr. Collins, at that
time Vicar, against all vestiges of the religion professed by
our forefathers. A few small panes of glass only remain,
and the cross engrailed Sable, on a field Or (the arms of
Mahon), can alone be distinguished. The south wall of the
church is supported by a continued buttress, added about
the year 1760.</p>

<p>On a slab stone, just before the communion table, is the
following inscription:</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. Collins died in October 1755, and was buried under
the same stone, but without any additional inscription. Mr.
Edward Collins was the eldest son of John Collins, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of
Treworgan, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme, and brother of Mr. John Collins,
Rector of Redruth. He studied for some years at the
Temple, with the view of being called to the bar, and it is
said that he became a clergyman from principles of conscience.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins retained uniformly through life the respect
of all around him; he appears to have been a man of learning
and of taste, but of austere manners. I have heard from
one who was present, that Mr. and Mrs. Collins meeting
accidentally, at a neighbouring gentleman’s, a lady who was
not of the Established Church, they refused to hold any
conversation with her.</p>

<p>Their only son, Mr. John Collins, Vicar of Ledbury in
Herefordshire, supported the reputation derived from his
father. He distinguished himself as a man of letters on various
occasions; one of the editors of Shakspeare left his
library to Mr. Collins, in gratitude for assistance afforded
him, and there may be found a very curious note at the conclusion
of Troilus and Cressida, in the edition by Johnson
and Steevens, with Mr. Collins’s name subscribed.</p>

<p>The next Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth was Mr. Symonds, who acquired
the living through a curious combination of circumstances.
Mr. John Stephens, the principal merchant at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, and agent for the Earl of Buckinghamshire in the management
<!--392.png--><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pageno">354</span>
of the borough, was a zealous Presbyterian. The
living of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives with Lelant, had been designed for some
young man of the town, who indiscreetly, and probably in
joke, declared that when he succeeded to the church he
would preach furiously against Presbyterians, and teach
that Hell itself was strewed over with their bones. This
was said in a garden, in defiance of the Cornish proverb,
Nynges gun heb lagas, na kei heb scover. “There is no
downs without eyes, nor hedge or wall without ears.” And
Mr. Stephens walking in a garden adjoining overheard this
declaration, and in consequence exerted his influence with
the patron to obtain the living from the Bishop of Exeter
for one who might prove less unfavourably disposed towards
his sect, the only one at that time considered as formidably
hostile to the Established Church; and to ensure this object
Mr. Symonds was selected, because his father, who exercised
the trade of a barber at Cambridge, discharged also the
office of clerk to a Presbyterian meeting-house.</p>

<p>Mr. Symonds was received as a friend at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and
elected into the Corporation. But in the course of a few
years a violent struggle arose respecting the election of a
Recorder, when Mr. Symonds most prudently considering
that nothing further was likely to be obtained from those who
had already given him a living, sold himself to the opposite
party, carried the election for them by his casting vote, and
received the living of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth. See various Essays in the
London Magazine, with the signature Y. Z. for 1767, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
225, 456, 464, 628; for 1768, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 25, 199, 575; for 1769,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 18, 235, 578.</p>

<p>Mr. Symonds died in 1775, and was succeeded by Mr.
George Rhodes, of Devonshire, some time a Fellow of
Exeter College. This gentleman having obtained preferment
near his immediate connections, resigned the living in
1781, and was succeeded by Mr. Mayow, of Bray near
Looe, who never resided, and died in the year 1800, when
the benefice was given to Mr. Samuel Gurney, recently deceased
(1833) and to whose memory a marble slab has been
<!--393.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pageno">355</span>
immediately placed over the chancel door by his mother, in
her ninety-fourth year.</p>

<p>The glebe land is more extensive and of greater value
than in most other parishes, and the vicarage house is one
of the best in Cornwall, a new front having been added by
Mr. Collins, and some improvements made by Mr. Rhodes.
There is also a rectorial glebe; and a large house near the
eastern end of the bridge, stands on the spot where formerly
was a barn for receiving the tithe corn.</p>

<p>There is a third slab stone in memory of Mr. Richard
Shuckburgh, brother to the well-known mathematician and
astronomer of Shuckborough, in Warwickshire. Mr.
Humphrey Williams, then the resident curate, had married
Miss Sarah Bate, his half-sister, who is also buried in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth’s church.</p>

<p>The church-yard is still too small for the parish, notwithstanding
its being enlarged in the year 1817, chiefly at the
expense of the Editor, and by virtue of a general Act of
parliament which he brought into the House of Commons
for that express purpose, 56 <abbr title="George Three">Geo. III.</abbr> c. 141.</p>

<p>The bridge is said by Leland to have been constructed
two hundred years before his time, or about five hundred
years ago. The causeway is very long, but there were originally
only three small arches. A fourth, somewhat larger,
has been added at the eastern end. The roadway was so
narrow that a single carriage had, at one part, great difficulty
to pass, and the whole created a large expense to the
county, occasioned by accidents to the walls, and by wheels
always running in the same track. In the year 1816, the
Editor procured a grant of fifty pounds, and, expending
somewhat more than an equal sum himself, he got the road
widened sufficiently for all useful purposes, more especially
as in the year 1825 a causeway was made across the river,
about a mile further down. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth adjoins to no less
than seven parishes: Lelant, Ludgvan, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilary, Breage,
Crowan, Gwinear, and Phillaek.</p>

<p><!--394.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pageno">356</span>
Trewinnard has been, without all comparison, the principal
place in this parish.</p>

<p>I have not any means of affirming or of contradicting the
relation of Mr. Hals, as to the tragical event imputed to
the last Trewinnard: some indistinct tradition of a murder
was handed down to within my remembrance. The transactions
of this gentleman’s grandfather with the House of
Commons are given by Mr. Hatsell, as derived from authentic
sources, in his Parliamentary Precedents, <abbr title="volume one, page">vol. i. p.</abbr> 59, of
the edition of 1796, and <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 60 in the last edition. I apprehend
that he was then Member for Helston. One of the family
resided till very lately in the Strand, London; for, struck
by the name “Trewinnard,” the Editor was induced to call
at the house. Mr. Trewinnard said that his family came,
as he had heard, from a town so called in Cornwall, and
that he had some old deeds in his possession. These were
exhibited, and proved to be leases of various farms in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Earth parish. The Mohuns appear to have made this place
a principal ressdence, for the cross engrailed exhibits itself
not only on fragments of painted glass preserved in the
church, but also on the seat or pew, quartered or impaled
with various arms, and in one instance with the fleur-de-lis
and the lions, of England and France.</p>

<p>Mr. Hals states that the estate was divided between the
three daughters of Sir Reginald Mohun; that one of these
daughters married Sir Thomas Arundel, of Talvorne, and
that his part was purchased by Sir Nicholas Hals, of Fentongallon,
who had the other two-thirds on leases for lives;
but that John Hals sold the whole. It is probable that
the purchaser must have been Mr. Bellot, of Bochym,
whose daughter brought the one-third freehold, and the
two-thirds lease for lives, to Mr. Thomas Hawkins; yet
Reginald Mohun is said by Mr. Lysons, under Cury, to
have given one of his daughters, with Bochym, to Francis
Bellot; through whom Mr. Hawkins, the present possessor,
connects himself with the ancient and baronial family
of Mohun.</p>

<p><!--395.png--><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a><span class="pageno">357</span>
However Mr. Thomas Hawkins acquired Trewinnard,
the property has now been possessed by his family above a
century and a half.</p>

<p>The <em>first</em> of his ancestors who settled in Cornwall was
Mr. John Hawkins, who is said to have come from Kent
in the year 1554. He married a daughter of the officiating
Minister of Blisland.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>, John Hawkins, their son, designated merchant,
married Jane Rother or Williams, of Grampound.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>, John Hawkins, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> married Paschas, daughter
of Joseph Cooke, of Mevagissey.</p>

<p><em>Fourth</em>, Thomas Hawkins, who died in the lifetime of
his father, married Adry, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Crudge.</p>

<p><em>Fifth</em>, John Hawkins, <abbr title="gentleman">gent.</abbr> married Loveday, daughter
of George Trenhayle.</p>

<p><em>Sixth</em>, Thomas Hawkins, their son, married, first, Florence,
daughter of James Praed, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> of Trevethow, by
whom he had one daughter, married to John Williams, of
Helston, merchant. He married, secondly, Ann, daughter
and coheir of Christopher Bellott, of Bochym, and died
in 1716, leaving one son and one daughter.</p>

<p><em>Seventh</em>, Christopher Hawkins, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> barrister-at-law,
married Mary, daughter and coheir of Philip Hawkins, of
Pennance, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> and practically his sole heiress, as well as
of her brother Philip Hawkins, D.D. sometime Master of
Pembroke college, Cambridge.</p>

<p>They resided during several years in London, where
Mr. Hawkins practised as a lawyer; but, having lost several
children, they determined on removing into the country,
and finally settled at Trewinnard about the year 1750.
They had one daughter, Jane, married to Sir Richard
Vyvyan, of Trelowarren. And</p>

<p><em>Eighth</em>, Thomas Hawkins, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who married Anne,
daughter of James Heywood, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> a merchant of London.
He represented Grampound in Parliament, and died in
1766, leaving four sons and one daughter.</p>

<p>Philip died at Eton.</p>

<p><!--396.png--><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a><span class="pageno">358</span>
Sir Christopher, Member for Michell, Grampound,
Penryn, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, in different Parliaments, and created
a Baronet July 28, 1791. He was a Fellow of the Royal,
Antiquarian, and Horticultural Societies, and published in
1811 “Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in
Cornwall, and on the Ictis of Diodorus Siculus.” He died
unmarried in 1829.</p>

<p>Thomas died a young man.</p>

<p>John Hawkins, the present representative of the family,
celebrated throughout Europe for his general knowledge
on all subjects, his science, literature, and travels, especially
through Greece, the most interesting portion of the ancient
world, married the only daughter of Mr. Sibthorpe, Member
for Lincoln, and has two sons and four daughters; the
eldest, Mr. John Heywood Hawkins, is a distinguished
Member of the present Parliament. His sister is the widow
of Mr. Trelawney Brereton.</p>

<p>The house at Trewinnard has been so much altered and
improved since Mr. Christopher Hawkins came to reside
there, about eighty years ago, as scarcely to leave a trace of
what it had been in former times; but the garden remains,
a pleasing specimen of cut yew, trim box, and thorn hedges.
There was also a building, detached from the house, supposed
to have been the ancient chapel, although, I think,
inaccurately, as it stood north and south. One of the upstairs
rooms has tapestry representing the victory of Constantine,
with his celebrated vision of the Cross. But,
above all, here are preserved the remains of an old coach,
suspended on long leathers without springs, and in general
form corresponding with the coach exhibited by the Lord
Mayor of London. I believe, however, that it is much less
ancient than has generally been supposed, and it has been
in actual use within seventy years.</p>

<p>Trewinnard has the advantage of a stream of water,
brought with great art over very uneven ground from a
distance of two or three miles, conducted into almost every
field, and supplying the house.</p>

<p><!--397.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pageno">359</span>
The place of next importance in this parish is Trelisick.
Perhaps the etymology of this word may be tre-lès-ick,
the town on the inclosed water, les, or lis, being an inclosed
place; and the river Hayle here expands itself into the
appearance of a lake; and the same circumstance applies
to Trelesick as the head of Falmouth harbour.</p>

<p>The tale related by Mr. Hals respecting the change of
name from De Camborne to Paynter, does not seem very
probable. I remember, however, a man of that family
who was a house-painter, and who would be driven into
most violent fits of passion when boys hallooed after him,
“Painter by name and painter by nature.”</p>

<p>Mr. Francis Paynter is said to have married, first, a
daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Sutherland, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> one of the Clerks of
the Admiralty, and to have had by her one son, who died
in his father’s lifetime. I apprehend that this son, James,
too warmly espousing the politics then most popular in
Cornwall, took an active part in proclaiming King James
on the death of Queen Anne; that he was indicted by the
victorious party, acquitted at Launceston, and welcomed
by bonfire and by ball from thence to the Land’s End.</p>

<p>Of the two daughters by his second marriage, with his
cousin of Boskenna, one made a most imprudent match with a
foreigner, and settled in France, leaving many descendants.</p>

<p>The other daughter, Mary, born in 1709, married a
very respectable gentleman, Mr. Hearle, of Penryn. They
acquired the other sister’s share of the property by purchase,
and the whole is now equally divided between the
families of her three daughters. One married the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
Henry Hawkins Tremayne, of Heligon; another Francis
Rodd, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Trebather; and the third Capt. Wallis, of
the Royal Navy, well known for his discovery of Otaheite,
in a voyage round the world.</p>

<p>The house at Trelisick has been greatly reduced in size;
but the whole place continues to bear the appearance of
a gentleman’s seat, and the property is much improved by
the rapid advance of trade and of establishments at Hayle.</p>

<p><!--398.png--><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a><span class="pageno">360</span>
This portion of the Hearle and Paynter estate has been
assigned to Mr. Francis Hearle Rodd.</p>

<p class="p2">The place next of importance in this parish was probably
Tredrea. The name, perhaps, imports the thoroughfare
town, as it lies on the way from Trewinnard to the
church.</p>

<p>There was here a large house inhabited by a family of the
same name, who appear in the parish register two centuries
ago as Esquires, a distinction then sparingly applied. The
property is said to have passed, by a mortgage unredeemed,
to the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyns of Crowan, who granted it on a lease for
lives, in the year 1685, to Mr. Matthew Phillips. One of
his daughters married Mr. John Davies, younger brother
of Henry Davies, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Bosence. Mr. John Davies had
a daughter, Catherine Davies, eventually heiresss of her
brother Henry Davies, and through him of her father and
uncle. Her son is the Editor of this work.</p>

<p>The old house at Tredrea having fallen into a state of
decay, Mr. Henry Davies took it down about the year
1750, and built <a name="err25" id="err25"></a>small a neat house on the same spot, where
the Editor still occasionally resides.</p>

<p>Bosence, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, has belonged time out of mind, (certainly
from before the reign of Henry the Seventh,) to the family
of Davies. On it there is a very perfect Roman entrenchment;
and various articles of Roman workmanship, found
on removing the earth, are described and figured by Dr. W.
Borlase, in his Antiquities of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 316, edit. 1759;
and also in a Paper communicated to the Royal Society in
1759, <abbr title="volume eleven, page">vol. xi. p.</abbr> 322, of the Abridgment; and the Articles
themselves having been presented by Mr. Henry Davies to

There is a vault belonging to the family of Hawkins;
and Mr. Christopher Hawkins, in 1767, and his widow,
Mrs. Mary Hawkins, in 1780, are laid in it, I believe with
some of their children; but there is not any inscription.</p>

<p class="p2">Perthcolumb presents some appearance of antiquity.
There is a tradition of its once having given a sheriff to
the county. The place now belongs to Mr. Andrew Hoskin,
descended from a very ancient family in the adjoining
parish of Lelant.</p>

<p>Gear has a good house, once the seat of another branch
of the Davieses, but bought by the Editor’s father.</p>

<p>Tregethes belonged for several descents to the Penroses.
It is now the property of Mr. Ellis, who resides in it.</p>

<p>About the year 1782, a mill was constructed on a part
of Trewinnard, for rolling copper and iron, by a company
established at Hayle thirty years before, on the supposed
patriotic principle of smelting our own copper ore; but,
after many years of competition against the smelting-works
in Wales, it was discovered that one shipload of copper ore
required three shiploads of coal, and that by importing
coal from Swansea to work the steam-engine, and by exporting
the ores to be smelted there, vessels were enabled
to obtain cargoes in both directions; and, in consequence,
the works at Trewinnard and at Hayle are no longer employed
for their original purposes.</p>

<p>The rage for importing coals to reduce our own ores at
home, which was epidemic about the middle of the last
century, seems to have originated from a confusion of ideas
in the application of analogies, the most abundant source
of error. It would be absurd to send our food across the
seas to be roasted or boiled; therefore the same principle
was extended to copper ore.</p>

<p>These establishments were, however, maintained for some
considerable time by the genius and the abilities of one
man. Mr. John Edwards had been taken as a clerk for
general business by Mr. Hawkins, just at the time when he
<!--403.png--><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a><span class="pageno">365</span>
and other Cornish gentlemen set on the copper-works.
Mr. Edwards soon forced himself into the chief management,
became a partner, and continued the works during the
whole of his life; not being distinguished merely as a merchant
or manufacturer, but as a scholar and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Gurlyn is said by Mr. Lysons to have been the residence
of various considerable families. It has, for perhaps a century,
been the joint property of Messrs. Gregor and Harris.
About the year 1760, Mr. John Millett, possessing a lease
of this place for lives, built an entirely new house there;
but the lease has been bought in by the gentleman seised
of the freehold, and the house taken down.</p>

<p>Treloweth is a manor heretofore the property of the
Tredreas. On a part of this manor stands a tin-smelting
house. Tin, by the laws of the Stannaries, must be reduced
to the metallic state in Cornwall; and much less
quantities of coal are required than in the case of copper.
Till about the commencement of the last century, all the
tin ores of Cornwall were smelted in small blast furnaces,
by means of charcoal or of peat. At that period some
Germans introduced the reverberatory furnace, and with
it the use of coal. Several smelting-houses were immediately
constructed by the gentlemen of the county, and
although not among the first, that at Treloweth. I have
ascertained the exact period of its building, from this circumstance,
that the workmen were interrupted by the total
eclipse of the sun, which happened about 15 minutes before
nine on the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of April, 1715, O. S.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Davies, the Editor’s great-uncle, was among
those who contributed to the building, and the crest of his
arms, a lamb carrying a flag, was adopted as a mark to
distinguish the slabs of this house; all the different smelting
and blowing houses having always used specific marks.
The crest, had, I presume, been originally taken in allusion
to the Welch and Cornish sound, at least of his name;
<dfn>davas</dfn> being Cornish for a sheep, or perhaps a shepherd.
This mark, however, conveyed to the minds of persons in
<!--404.png--><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a><span class="pageno">366</span>
Catholic countries some idea of consecration, and procured
a preference for the Lamb Tin, although it never
claimed to have the slightest superiority; and finally, all
the other houses have taken the same, or similar marks.</p>

<p>Among the Germans who introduced the reverberatory
furnace, was the celebrated Becker. His son became a
bricklayer, and his grandson’s widow died about twenty-five
years ago in the poorhouse at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> John Ralph, Vicar of Ingatestone, son of the
Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, gave in 1754 a hundred pounds towards
founding a school at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth, to be applied as Mr.
Collins, the then Vicar, and Mr. Hawking, of Trewinnard,
should direct. Some portion of the 100<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> was expended in
repairing a small house in the church-yard. The remainder,
together with another hundred pounds, given by
Mr. Hawkins, remain in aid of the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>This parish measures 3,791 statute acres.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth is situated on felspar and hornblende rocks
belonging to the porphyritic series. In many parts these
rocks are so silicious as to give rise to very unproductive
soils; but in other places, where the felspar predominates,
the land is very fertile. These rocks are traversed by metalliferous
veins, which are richer in copper than in tin ores.</p>

<p>Park, that is, a field of any sort, otherwise in this parish
it signifies a deer-park, was one of the ancient seats of the
Peverells, lineally descended from William the Conqueror,
by Jane his concubine, the wife of Randolph Peverell, of
Hatfield-Peverell parish, in Witham Decanatus, in the
county of Essex, who abdicated the said Jane, and left her
wholly on the Conqueror’s hands, who had issue by her a
son, named William Peverell, (who, because born during
the joint marriage and lives of the said Randolph and Jane,
was surnamed Peverell,) upon whom the Conqueror settled
the honor, manor, and borough of Nottingham, and town
of Lyndeby, on him, and his heirs male. [Here Mr. Hals
goes into a long history of the Peverells, wholly unconnected
with Cornwall.]</p>

<p><!--406.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pageno">368</span>
Thomas Peverell, of Park, a supposed descendant of the
Conqueror’s son, who was also of Ermington and Sandford,
in Devon, was Sheriff of Cornwall 13 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
He was also Sheriff of Devon 20 Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Richard
Peverell, his son, was Sheriff of Devon 14 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> who
dying without issue male, his lands went in marriage with
his daughter, married to Basset of Umberleigh, Botreaux,
and others.</p>

<p>On this lordship of Park those gentlemen had their
deer-park, some of the walls and fences being yet standing;
their tower-house, and other buildings answerable, their
gardens, walk, and fish-ponds beneath the same, the ruins
whereof are yet extant. How those lands descended down
from Peverell’s heirs to the last age I know not; about
which time it was in the possession of Opie and Hickes;
from whom it passed by sale to the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> John Molesworth,
<abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Queen Anne, as I take it.</p>

<p>The arms of Peverell were, Gules, a fess Argent between
six crosses pattée Or.</p>

<p>Those Peverells are especially memorable here by two
crosses of moorstone in the highway set up by them, still
extant, and called Peverell’s Crosses. Not far from them
is another moorstone cross, near Mount-Charles, called
the Prior’s Cross, whereon is cut the figure of a hook and
a crook, in memory of that privilege and freedom granted
by him to the poor of Bodmin, for gathering, for fire-boote
and house-boote, such boughs and branches of oak-trees in
his contiguous wood of Dunmear, as they could reach to or
come at with a hook and a crook, without further damage
to the trees thereof. From whence arose the Cornish proverb,
concerning filching, purloining, or taking another
person’s goods, overmuch or indirectly, beyond what is
allowed them, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> “that they will have it by hook or by
crook.”</p>

<p>Pen-carou, Pen-caro, alias Pen-carow, i. e. head-deer, or
chief-deer, formerly part of the Peverell’s deer-park; and
from thence so denominated, as some think. But when I
<!--407.png--><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a><span class="pageno">369</span>
consider that Caer-kynock, or Caer-kunock, is situate on
the lands thereof, now called Castle-kynock, i. e. the king,
prince, or sovereign’s castle, extant here long before the
Norman Conquest, I take the modern name Pen-carow
only to be a corruption of Pen-caer-ou, or Pen-caer-ow,
i. e. my head castle, or city, intrenched or fortified place,
according to the artificial and natural circumstances thereof,
it being on a high hill, overlooking the contiguous
country, the ruins are of the largest British camp or intrenchment
that ever I saw in Cornwall, containing about 100
acres of land, and consisting of a four-fold rampart, yet of
a great height in some places, with several platforms or
counterscarps within the same, for offence or defence, in
case of storm or surprise.</p>

<p>[The camp in Pencarrow Park has a double vallum, the
inner one oval, inclosing an area 250 feet by 200; the
outer one of an irregular form. On the east side, at the
distance of about 700 feet from this camp, are some extensive
outworks. <cite>Lysons.</cite>]</p>

<p>This barton gave name and original to an old family of
gentlemen, surnamed De Pen-carow, who siding with
Richard the Third against Henry the Seventh, as some
say, but, as others will have it, with Flammock, in his insurrection
against that King, he lost this place, and other
lands, by attainder of treason (see Bocarne, in <a href="#Bodmin"><span class="sc">Bodmin</span></a>),
having before conveyed a great part of his estate to Henry
the first Lord Marney, of Colquitta, to procure a reprieve,
or pardon of his life, from that king; from whose heirs it
came to the Walkers of Exeter, by descent or purchase, and
from them to John Molesworth, of Tretane, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> first but
an attorney-at-law, afterwards commissioner or auditor to
Queen Elizabeth in those parts for the Duchy of Cornwall,
that married one of the coheirs of Hender, so called from
the parish of Molesworth, in Lightstone hundred, in the
county of Huntingdon.</p>

<p>From the local place aforesaid, was denominated Walter
de Molesworth, Sheriff of Bedfordshire, from the 26th to
<!--408.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pageno">370</span>
the 36th of Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> anno <abbr title="Domini">Dom.</abbr> 1298; the which gentleman
accompanied King Edward into Palestine, and returned
with him safe into England again. After the decease
of the said Edward, he was knighted by King Edward
the Second, and was made Sheriff of Bedfordshire again
by the name of Walter de Molesworth, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> from the 6th
to the 9th of Edward <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 1316, in which year he died, and
was succeeded by John de Pabenham. From which gentleman,
as I am informed, was lineally descended John
Molesworth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> aforesaid, that married Hender, and by
her had issue, Hender Molesworth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that married
Spark of Plymouth, and by her had issue my very kind
friend John Molesworth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and Hender Molesworth,
with a daughter married to Dr. Hart; the which John
Molesworth married two wives, Wise, and Slannen, the
relict of Legard, afterwards knighted by Charles the
Second, and had issued by Wise, John Molesworth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
that married Arscott of Tetcot, and hath issue, Hender
Molesworth aforesaid, the son of Hender Molesworth, who
being bred a soldier, managed affairs with that valour
and conduct, that, after passing gradually to the dignity of
a colonel, he was by King James the Second made a baronet
of England, and governor of the Island of Jamaica, where
he purchased a considerable estate in land, and called it
Tremolesworth, which, together with his honour (if he died
without issue male, according to the limitation of his letters
patent as a baronet), is now legally descended to Sir John
Molesworth, of Pencarow, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> The arms of Molesworth
are, Vaire, a bordure Gules, charged with eight cross-crosslets
Argent.</p>

<p>Kestell, in this parish, i. e. a castle, so called, I presume,
for that heretofore it had upon the lands thereof some
camp or castle-like intrenchment, for kestell is derived
from the provincial Latin of the Romans in Britain,
<dfn>castrum</dfn>, or <dfn>castellum</dfn>; which place gave name and original
to an old family of gentlemen, surnamed de Kestell. The
<!--409.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pageno">371</span>
first possessor thereof of this tribe, as appears from the
record in the Office of Arms, was John de Kestell, <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr>
Edward <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> where his posterity have ever since flourished,
to the time of writing hereof, in good fame and reputation,
between the degrees of a justice of the peace and that of a
hundred constable; the present possessor James Kestell,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Vaughan of Trewothick and Ottery, in
Devon, his father Kestell of Manacow, and giveth for his
arms, Argent, three falcons Proper; as also, Or, three
castles turreted Gules. (See Kestel, in <span class="sc">Manaccan</span>.)</p>

<p>Pen-davy, or Pen-duffy, i. e. David’s head, (why so
called, qu.?) a head or promontory of land situate between
the Alan and the Kestell rivers, was formerly the
lands of Kestell (and before that the Prior of Bodmin’s,
as I am informed); by Kestell’s daughter and heir it
passed in marriage to Nathaniel Moyle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> barrister-at-law,
of Bakehouse, who for want of issue sold it to Mr.
Ustick, now in possession thereof.</p>

<p>Crone, Croan, in this parish, signifies a skin or hide of
leather; so called either from the tanner that made or
sold leather here, or rather for that this tenement consisteth

<p>Treg-leah, in this parish, i. e. the law town or dwelling,
is the lands of William Keckwitch, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> a younger branch
of the Keckwitches of Trehawke, and giveth for his arms,
Argent, in bend two lions passant Sable. It was since
sold to Mr. Hoblyn.</p>

<p>In this parish is Castle Killy-biry, or Killy-biny, consisting
of about six acres of ground upon a well-advanced hill,
within a treble intrenchment of earth. Perhaps one of the
castles possessed by that arch-traitor the Pictish Mordred,
slain by King Arthur, (see <a href="#Dundagell"><span class="sc">Dundagell</span></a>,) from whence his
soldiers were routed; for the circumstance of this castle
on the Alan river may agree with those verses mentioned
under Lentegles by Camelford, for the river Camel
is properly called the Alan river, as well as Camel.</p>

<p>Below Egles-hayle church (on the Alan river as aforesaid),
where the sea creek or cove of Padstow Haven
makes its daily flux and reflux, stands Ward Bridge, i. e.
guard or watch bridge; otherwise, as Mr. Carew says,
called Wade Bridge, from a little ford near it, which
afforded, when the tide was out, a short but dangerous
passage over it. But where this little <dfn>vadum</dfn>, or ford,
should be, I know not, there being no other river to pass
over from east to west but the Alan river aforesaid. Which
bridge, as an artificial ligament, fasteneth the two parishes
of Egles-hayle and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock together, they being in all
other places separated by the river. It was built in the
latter end of Edward the Fourth’s reign, and beginning
of Henry the Seventh’s; not, as Leland says, at the
county charge, but, as all other works of this kind were,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> by collections, and commutation of penance for sins
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a><span class="pageno">373</span>
committed; for it was not made a county bridge till the
beginning of James the First’s reign. Now this licence of
all spiritual benedictions, collection, and commutation of
penance, throughout the counties of Cornwall and Devon,
was there granted by Dr. Peter Courtenay, Bishop of
Exeter, to Thomas Longbound, then Vicar of Egles-hayle,
his chaplain or vicar, 1485, who raised a considerable sum
of money by that means, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> of absolution, as also from
charitable and well-disposed Christians. The undertaker,
that expert mason John de Harlyn, and the treasurer Longbound,
brought the bridge’s building to that perfection as it
now stands, consisting of seventeen arches of stone of great
height and magnitude, all built with great cost and labour,
through which (as aforesaid) the sea passes up and down
daily through the Alan river to Tagus, (i. e. Goodwood,)
a mile, and is navigable for boats, barges, and lighters, to
that place, which there bring sea sand, and other commodities,
for the country-people’s use.</p>

<p>On the lower side of the bridge, from Padstow Haven,
ships and barks laden with merchandise frequently arrive,
of burthen from twenty to sixty tons, from Bristol, Wales,
Ireland, and other places, where their commodities have
better vent than at Padstow, two or three miles below,
nearer the main sea.</p>

<p>Leland, in his Itinerary, tells us, volume the second, that
some of the arches of this bridge were laid upon quicksand,
which for some time made the treasurer and undertaker
despair of success, till they projected the laying of
packs of wool under the groundwork, which proved such a
useful expedient as carried on the fabric according to their
desire, and the same stands firm to this day.</p>

<p>After this bridge was erected, Longbound, the vicar,
gave a small parcel of land towards the repair thereof, now
worth 20<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum, and enfeoffed the twelve men of
this parish, and their successors, in trust with the same for
ever. There are also other lands in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Breock, given by
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pageno">374</span>
the Prior of Bodmin, and other well-affected benefactors
to the bridge, for the same purpose. At present this
bridge stock is about 300<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> and is set at the yearly rent for
about 10<span class="value"><abbr title="pounds">l.</abbr></span> per annum. Lastly, this just and indefatigable
benefactor Longbound, after he had finished the bridge,
with the moneys and stones left, caused to be built the
tower of Egles-hayle church, as it now stands; over the
belfry-door of which, in stone, on the north side, are cut
in an escutcheon his arms, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a human heart, and superscribed
Longbound. On the other side of the door aforesaid
are cut, impaled, a chevron between two falcons, and
a chevron between three ravens’ heads. Which first I
take to be the arms of Kestell, and the latter of Ravenscroft
of Cheshire, his wife.</p>

<p>From this parish was denominated an old family of gentlemen
surnamed de Egles-hayle, of which family was Matheus
de Egleshayle, Sheriff of Devon from the 1st year
of Edward the First to the 6th, who gave for his arms,
Argent, a cross Sable, and a fleur-de-lis in the first quarter.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>In this parish stands the lordship and barton of Pencarrow,
which name may signify a deer-park. But I take
the name of Pencarrow to be of a much more ancient date
than the first bringing of deer into this land, and that the
name is taken from the natural circumstances of the place,
as compounded of pen-car-ow, head-rock-ry, for in this
place is digged a quarry of bright clear freestone, that
works with tool, plane, or hammer, equal to any other in
Cornwall, as may be seen by the beautiful house Sir John
Molesworth has built with it, and which is not yet quite
finished. And surely it may be said of this barton, without
disparagement to any other man’s lands, that for wood,
water, and stone, it may compare with, if not exceed, any
other part of the kingdom; neither do the lands come
<!--413.png--><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a><span class="pageno">375</span>
behind any in the neighbourhood for fruitfulness. It is
the seat of Sir John Molesworth, <abbr title="Knight">Knt.</abbr> and <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> who was
knighted by Charles the Second, and succeeded to the
title of baronet by the issueless decease of his younger
brother, Sir Hender Molesworth, Governor of Jamaica,
who left him a considerable estate in that island, and was
the first baronet created by William the Third. This
family is a younger branch of the descendants of Sir Walter
de Molesworth, of Northamptonshire, who flourished
in martial prowess in the days of Edward the First, and
went with him to the Holy Land. John Molesworth,
son of the above Sir John Molesworth, married the daughter
of &mdash;&mdash; Arscot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Tetcot, in Devonshire.</p>

<p>Kestle. The very name implies that heretofore it was a
fortified place. Here liveth James Kestle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> from thence
denominated ever since that John de Kestle, lord of this
place in the time of Edward the First, assumed that name;
where his posterity, for about twenty descents, have ever
since flourished in good fame and reputation; and give for
their arms, Argent, a chevron Sable between three falcons
Proper, armed with tasses and bells Or. Their crest, a
castle Gules.</p>

<p>Pendavy, the good promontory, is situated on a hill
forming a peninsula by the river Alan, on the west side,
and a rivulet which has two heads, one in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Teath and
the other in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn, on the east side. Here dwelleth
Nathaniel Moyle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a younger brother of Sir Walter
Moyle, of Bake; to whom, by his marriage with Johan,
the daughter and heir of Thomas Kestle, of this place,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the lordship descended. Mr. Moyle having only one
son, of the same name as himself, by this marriage, that
died unmarried about four years since, and being something
indebted, sold this lordship (which claimeth a royalty
over all the river, and the bushelage of all goods brought
up to Wade bridge) for a very considerable value (reserving
his own and his lady’s lives on the barton), in the year
1703, to Michael Ustick, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> collector of Bideford, and
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pageno">376</span>
second brother to Oliver Ustick, of Lea, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Burian,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p>The Harbour of Padstow is navigable every tide up to
this place, where vessels of sixty or seventy tons carry and
recarry their loading of such commodities as the country
needs, coal, salt, limestone, <abbr title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> and here they find generally
a better vent for their goods than at Padstow, near
the mouth of the river, which has occasioned the building
of some houses on each side of the bridge, but mostly on
the eastern, where are indifferent good quarters for travellers,
who are sometimes forced to stop here against their
wills, there being no passing over the bridge to the west in
high spring tides, by reason that the ground on the western
side is very low, and at such times overflowed with the sea.</p>

<p>Croan, the cross. Mr. Edward Hoblin built a good
house at this place, and left it to his eldest son, of the same
name, who was sheriff of Cornwall 8th George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> He
married Barbara, the second daughter and coheir of Henry
Hawkins, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> by whom he had only one
daughter, Damaris.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Wade Bridge has a considerable number of houses on
both sides of the river; and I apprehend that no inconvenience
is now experienced from high tides on the western
side. A toll has been levied for some years past, in aid of
the revenue left for its repair; and in this year (1833) a
railway, or tram road, is being constructed from thence
to Bodmin.</p>

<p>Pendavy was inhabited by Mr. Ustick, the son or successor
of Mr. Richard Ustick, who made the purchase.
This gentleman married Catherine Trewren, daughter of
the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Richard Trewren, of Trewardreva, Rector of
Withyell, and Catherine Davies, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Ustick parted with Pendavy from a cause similar to
that which induced the former proprietor to sell it; and
<!--415.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pageno">377</span>
his widow, left without a family, or much provision, resided
at Padstow till her decease in 1791. Pendavy now belongs
to Sir William Molesworth.</p>

<p>Crowan was given by the will of Mrs. Damaris Kirkham
to her first cousin, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Hawkins Tremayne,
and it is now the property of his son, John Hearle Tremayne,

<p>In the Domesday Roll, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> (1087), this district
was taxed under the name of Pen-hall-an, now Penheale,
then and still the voke lands of a considerable manor.
Soon after the Norman Conquest, if not before, the De
Boterells, alias De Botreauxes, were possessed of this place;
for in the time of Henry the Second and Richard the
First, Richard de Botreaux held 12 knights’ fees in Cornwall
(Carew’s Survey thereof, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 49); one of which was
held of the King in this place by his posterity to the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr>
Henry the Fourth; where we further read, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 41: “William
de Boteraux tenet dimid. part. feod. de Morton, in
Penhele, de Rege.” From the Botreauxes, for want of issue
male, those lands, by a daughter, with much other, were
carried in marriage to Hungerford; as Hungerfords’ heirs,
in like manner, carried it to Hastings. By Hastings, Earl
of Huntingdon, it was sold to George Grenvill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> that
married Julyan, one of the daughters of William Vyell, of
Trevorder, who sold it to John Speccot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of

<p>The <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> John Speccot, three times Knight of the
Shire, married the Lady Essex Robartes, daughter of the
Right <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> John Earl of Radnor, but on the very day

the small-pox; and the lady experienced a fatal attack
from the same dreadful disease about a month afterwards,
just as her husband was getting well. His father married
a daughter of John Eliot, of Port Eliot, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Mr. John
Speccot died in August 1703, without issue, and gave a
great deal to charitable uses; but he devised the bulk of
his estate to the heirs of his aunt, and, after many lawsuits
and disputes, his first cousin, Thomas Long, came into
possession of Penhele. He was Sheriff of Cornwall In
1724, and left one son, John Speccot Long, and three
daughters. This gentleman died <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine prole</i>. He was the
last male heir, and the property went among his sisters.</p>

<p>Of the three sisters of Mr. John Speccot Long, one remained
single. Another married Mr. Charles Phillipps,
of Camelford, eldest son of Mr. John Phillipps, attorney-at-law.
This gentleman represented Camelford in Parliament,
and was Lieutenant-Colonel of the Cornwall Militia.
He survived his wife, and acquired through her a third
part of the Long property, which, with all his other possessions,
he bequeathed in equal portions to his two brothers,
Mr. Jonathan Phillipps, a Captain with him in the
militia, and the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> William Phillipps, Rector of Lanteglos,
the parish including Camelford. These two brothers
came to some arrangement with the two sisters, by which
this share of Penhale at least reverted to them.</p>

<p>The third sister, Margaret Long, first married Mr.
Charles Davie, of the family settled at Orleigh, in Devonshire.
He carried on, however, some business in Bristol,
and is said to have been in very bad circumstances. He
died after a few years, and in her old age the widow was
induced to marry Mr. John Bridlake Herring, a Major in
the army, who resorted to all possible methods for extorting
money from the old lady; one that will scarcely be
credited, by terrifying her with supposed apparitions. The
three sisters are reputed to have excelled in beauty of person,
but to have been so utterly neglected in their education,
as scarcely to possess the common acquirement of
reading.</p>

<p>The Editor remembers to have seen Penhale and the old
lady in 1788. Her appearance, then near eighty, justified
the report respecting her youth, and the house seemed to
rank among the very finest specimens of ancient buildings
in Cornwall, as well for size as for architectural decoration.
Near the entrance stood a very curious dial, probably
placed there by Mr John Speccot, who founded a mathematical
school.</p>

<p>The barton of Penhale is again divided; one portion

<p class="p2 center small">THE GEOLOGY, BY DR. BOASE.</p>

<p>Egles-Kerry is almost entirely situated on that extensive
chain of downs, which runs across the country from Launceston
to the Bristol Channel; composed of rocks which
are very quartzose, but in many parts appear to be almost
entirely felspar, commonly, however, united with some
colouring material which stains them to a dark blue. This
is particularly the case near the church, where the rocks
very strongly resemble those at Rosecradock, and in other
parts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Cleer. Northward, these rocks appear to pass
into the Dunstone; but it must be confessed that their
geological position is not yet elucidated; for, like the
compact rocks of King Arthur’s Castle in Tintagel, of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s, and Pentire Points, on each side of Padstow
Harbour, and elsewhere, they yet require to be carefully
and patiently investigated.</p>

true is that saying, “Man doth not always flourish,” the

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedellyan has been long celebrated for its mines of
antimony. This metal occurs in the state of a sulphuret,
associated with iron pyrites, in quartz veins, which run east
and west, traversing a blue lamellar slate, very similar to
that which frequently abounds in the calcareous series, and
to which, indeed, this slate belongs. Some curious varieties
of rocks in this series are found in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedellyan, one of
which, in particular, abounds between the church and Port
Isaac, which was noticed by Sir Humphrey Davy in a
decomposing state, under the name of mandelstone. In
this state it is a dull earthy argillaceous rock, of an ochreous
colour, full of small, roundish cavities. In its perfect
state this rock is a greenish-grey, glossy, compact felspar,
containing granules of flesh-coloured calcareous spar, and
minute prisms of hornblende. During decomposition, the
calcareous spar is dissolved, and washed away by the rainwater,
which produces the honeycomb appearance; and
the ferruginous stain is derived from the iron contained in
the hornblende. This rock has been described by Mr.
Prideaux as occurring in Devon. It is very rare in Cornwall.

<p>Some of the inhabitants of this parish have told me that
one <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Athenodorus is the tutelar guardian of this church,
from whom it is denominated Enador. Athenodorus, the
stoic philosopher of Athens, was born before Christ Jesus,
and was tutor to the Emperor Augustus, who taught him
that he should neither do or say any thing, but take respite
till he could say over the Greek alphabet, that so he might
neither say or do any thing through rashness or anger; for
which advice he is specially remembered.</p>

<p>This parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Enedor is the flattest or levellest parish
of lands in Cornwall, and, by consequence, the storehouse
or preserver of moisture, or water; and in testimony
of the wateryness of this soil, I do remember that in the
latter end of the reign of King Charles the Second, the
tower of this church sunk in its foundation, so much that
the whole fabric fell to the ground, and greatly damnified
the church with its stones; which church and tower, by
the Bishop of Exeter’s grant of a collection throughout his

<p>Athenodorus, to whom this church is dedicated, is a saint
in the Roman Calendar, and brother to Gregory Thaumaturgus,
or the miracle-worker, both natives of Neocæserea,
in Pontus, or Cappadocia; of noble extraction, very
well skilled in the sciences, the knowledge of tongues, and
philosophy; who, hearing of the great fame of Origen,
came to hear him, and were by his learned lessons, and
holy exhortations, brought to leave the Pagan philosophy
and all mundane sciences, and to embrace the holy theology,
in which they made so great a progress in the space
of five years, under so good a master, that, although they
were both very young, they were honoured with the office
of Bishops in the churches of Pontus. This <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Athenodorus
suffered martyrdom about the year 272, under
Aurelian.</p>

<p>In this parish are situated three villages, called Summercourt,
Penhale, and Fraddon, each of which had formerly
the privilege of holding an annual fair. All are now transferred
to Somercourt. One held on the 25th of September,
is considered to be the most important in Cornwall. The
name is obviously modern, although the village itself seems
to be quite as ancient as any in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There is in this parish also another village, of considerable
importance up to the year 1832, called Michell, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael, or Modeshole.</p>

<p><!--427.png--><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pageno">389</span>
This place, although never entitled, by the utmost
stretch of courtesy, to the appellation of a town, was privileged
with sending Members to Parliament in the time of
King Edward the Sixth, probably to increase the political
power of the Lords Arundell, who then possessed the paramount
manor of Michel, together with an unrivalled influence
in that part of Cornwall.</p>

<p>Many of the small places in Cornwall received this privilege
from the Tudors, for the express purpose of becoming
close or nomination boroughs, withdrawn as they
then were from public view or attention.</p>

<p>The system thus created has acted at different periods in
various ways. At first, many of the small Boroughs returned
neighbouring gentlemen to Parliament, the natural aristocracy
of the country, and practically the peers of other
gentlemen holding hereditary seats, and distinguished by
the shadowy appellation of offices long since extinct. These
representatives formed the strongest bulwark of national
liberty in the subsequent reigns of the Stuarts. So that
Charles the Second, and his brother King James, endeavoured
to smooth the way for their progress towards
despotism by invading chartered or prescriptive rights;
and thus the inviolability of these rights became associated
in men’s minds, after the Revolution, with the very idea of
liberty itself; and this union remained so permanently
fixed and strong at the distance of a century, as to dash in
pieces the otherwise powerful administration of Mr. Fox
and Lord North, because they proposed to interfere authoritatively
with the Charter of the East India Company.
Times were, however, at that period completely changed.
The English Empire had extended itself into all parts of the
globe; an immense manufacturing and commercial interest
had grown up; and, of still greater consequence, the national
debt had created a vast monied capital, not subject
to the laws of primogeniture, and therefore inclined towards
democracy. All these obtained representatives
through the small Boroughs, but tempered in most cases
<!--428.png--><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pageno">390</span>
by the media through which the seats were acquired.
Statesmen by profession, and many inclined to support the
existing order of things by their situation in life, and by
their connection, obtained admission also into Parliament
in the same manner, and all these, united with the representatives
of counties, and of large towns, formed an assembly,
owing its existence, no doubt, to accidental causes, but, in
the opinion of many wise and experienced men, better
adapted to the government of a great country than any one
that the world had seen, or than could be established by
systematic arrangements.</p>

<p>That House of Commons has been swept away by the
enactment of 1832; and it remains to be proved by an experiment,
at which bold men might shrink, whether a more
direct delegation will as effectually represent all the varied
materials of the State, and whether a body so powerful
may not ultimately absorb into its immediate superintendence
the whole legislative and executive functions.</p>

<p>Michell had to boast among its representatives of Sir
Walter Ralegh, of Mr. Carew, the historian of Cornwall,
and of many distinguished gentlemen of the county. It
used to be said, that Colonel Clive spent so much money in
a contest for this place as to occasion his return to India,
where he gained the battle of Plassey, and established the
Eastern Empire.</p>

<p>The right of election seems to have been vague and undefined
at Michell, as it was in early times at almost all
other places; but repeated decisions of the House of Commons
tended to ascertain, and usually to abridge the right,
as this was deemed most favourable to the new Government;
and finally, by Act of Parliament in <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
the last decision of the House of Commons on any right of
voting acquired the force and authority of law.</p>

<p>Such a decision took place with respect to Michell in
the year 1700, fixing the right of voting in the possessors of
five burgage tenures, here denominated mesne lordships,
and in all resident payers of scot and lot. Property
<!--429.png--><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a><span class="pageno">391</span>
within the limits of the borough being divided, and each
possessor of land wishing to multiply voters, they were
raised to the amount of sixty or eighty, till at last the
whole property coming into the hands of two Cornish gentlemen,
they, in promotion of a system which may yet be
regretted, consolidated the land, let the better houses on
conditions, such as to prevent the occupiers from appearing
on the parish rates, and converted to farm shelters, or
took down, hovels that were originally constructed for
election purposes. Contests were thus avoided, and the
borough rendered close; the two proprietors having mutually
pledged themselves in writing to support each other in
their equal shares.</p>

<p>One of the proprietors died, and his son continued to
act on the agreement. The other proprietor also died;
and his brother having verbally ratified the compact, continued
also to act on it, and a joint return was made in
1830. But a total change of men and measures having
taken place in the administration of Government, the Reform
Bill was introduced, and so powerful is the action of
party feelings on the most honourable minds, heightened
as they were, on this important occasion, by an honest conviction
generally entertained on all sides, of the real and
permanent welfare of the country being involved, that one
of the proprietors thought himself absolved from adhering
to the contract, unless his associate would take the same
line of politics on this great subject as himself. A poll
was thereupon called for, and the numbers were, for
Kenyon five, for Best three, and Hawkins two; one voter
having been got over by the infringing party.</p>

<p>Pencoose is now the property of Mr. William Basset,
having been purchased from the Fortescues.</p>

<p>Trewhele belongs to Mr. John Basset, of this parish.</p>

<p>Treweere is held in joint tenantry by Mr. Retollock,
son of Mr. Retollock who resided at Michell as agent for
the borough, and Sir Richard Vyvyan, of Trelowarren.
This place is considered to be a barton; and it must
<!--430.png--><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a><span class="pageno">392</span>
formerly have been the residence of some gentleman,
although the place is now reduced to a common farm.</p>

<p>Gomronson, heretofore the property of the Flammocks,
now belongs to Hawkins.</p>

<p>Boswallow was purchased by Mr. John Stephens, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Ives, about the middle of the last century, and now belongs
to his grandson, Mr. Samuel Stephens, of Tregenna.</p>

<p>The paramount manor of Michell has passed into various
families, on account of its political importance. Originally
Arundell’s, it for some time belonged to the Scawens, an
ancient race of Cornish gentlemen now extinct. One of
the family held the honourable, and then gratuitous, office
of Vice Warden, on the Restoration of King Charles the
Second.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_42" id="fnanchor_42"></a><a href="#footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></span>
This manor was finally purchased by the late
Sir Christopher Hawkins, and belonged to his devisee at
the period of the general dissolution of close boroughs.</p>

<p>The following short account of the patron saint is substituted
for six or eight pages of uninteresting legend given
by Mr. Hals.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hermes or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ermes, the supposed patron saint of
this parish, is said to have suffered martyrdom at Rome in
the persecution raised by the Emperor Adrian, about the
year 132. His tomb in the Salian Way was ornamented by
Pope Pelagius the Second, who filled the chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter
from 577 to 590. The name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hermes is much celebrated
in the ancient martyrologies.</p>

<p>In the Missale Romanum is the following prayer, to be
used on the 28th of August, the day consecrated to his
memory:</p>

<p class="blockquote" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus, qui beatum Hermetem Martyrem tuum virtute
constantiæ in passione roborasti, ex ejus nobis imitatione
<!--432.png--><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pageno">394</span>
tribue, pro amore tuo, prospera mundi despicere, et nulla
ejus adversa formidare. Per Dominum nostrum Jesum
Christum filium tuum.</p>

<p>Tre-gasa, alias Tre-gaza, in this parish, id est, the wood
town, to prove which etymology there is still extant a considerable
wood adjoining to the town place thereof, was the
dwelling of Thomas Coke, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 27
Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> that married Lance, his father Herle. His grandfather
John Coke, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> attorney at law, of Trerice, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Allen, who first came into those parts <abbr title="tempore">temp.</abbr> Elizabeth,
from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary Ottery, in Devon, without money or goods,
placed himself a servant or steward under Sir Francis
Godolphin, Knight, where he began from, and with his
inkhorn and pen, to turn all things that he touched into
gold (as King Gyges), and that by indirect arts and practices
as tradition saith; for that Sir Francis taking a great
liking to him, left the management of his estate and great
tin works to him, his said steward Coke. He accordingly
took care that all such tin of his master’s as was melted at
the blowing-house into slabs or blocks, was justly marked
with the dolphin stamp, as is customarily done on those
gentlemen’s tin to this day. After some years, Mr. Coke
remaining in service as aforesaid, by his subtle arts and contrivances,
out of Sir Francis’ toll, and the shares of other
adventurers, and the wages of labouring tinners, he produced
considerable quantities of his own block tin, which,
when melted at the blowing-house, as aforesaid, to distinguish
it from his master’s, he marked thereon the figure of
a cat; the same, it seems, being the coat armour of his family
or ancestors. At length, against coinage time there
was more tin brought by Mr. Coke to be coined at the coinage
towns, marked with the cat, than there was of his master’s
marked with the dolphin.</p>

<p>Whereupon, Sir Francis’s Lady being informed of his
ill practices, and resolving by the next coinage to be better
instructed in this mystery, at such time as Godolphin
blowing-house was at work, privately, with one of her
<!--433.png--><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pageno">395</span>
maids, in a morning, on foot, went to that place, where according,
as common fame reported, she found many more
blocks or slabs of tin marked with the cat than there were
with the dolphin; the one part pertaining to Sir Francis,
the other to Mr. Coke. Whereupon, abundantly satisfied,
the returned to Godolphin House, but could not be there
timely enough against dinner; whereat Sir Francis was
greatly distasted, having at that time several strangers to
dine with him. At length the lady being arrived, she
asked all their pardons for her absence, and told them it
did not proceed from any neglect or want of respect, but
from an absolute necessity of seeing a strange and unheard-of
piece of curiosity, which could not be seen at any other
time; <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> to see the cat eat the dolphin (indeed cats are
great lovers of fish elsewhere as experience shews) and then
gave an account of the premises, to their great wonder and
admiration: whereupon, soon after, Sir Francis dismissed
him from his service. But by that time he had gotten so
much riches, that forthwith he purchased the little barton
and manor of Trerice, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen, and made that place
his habitation till he purchased this barton and manor of
Tregasa, and seated himself here; where, by parsimony
and the inferior practice of the law, he accumulated a very
considerable estate in those parts. But, maugre all his
thrift and conduct in providing wealth for himself and posterity,
his grandson Thomas Coke, aforesaid, succeeding to
his estate, upon the issueless decease of his elder brother
Christopher Coke, and buying in his widow’s jointure at a
dear rate, and also undertaking the building of the present
new and finely-contrived house at Tregasa, though never
finished, yet the said fabric was so costly and chargeable
to him, together with the vain extravagance of his wife
(Lance), that he was necessitated to sell divers parcels of
lands, in order to raise money for his necessary occasions;
and finally to mortgage this manor and barton of Tregasa,
and all his other lands that were before unsold, for about
fourteen thousand pounds, to Hugh Boscawen, of Tregothnan,
<!--434.png--><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a><span class="pageno">396</span>
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and lastly, for that consideration and others, did,
by lease and release, fine and proclamation, convey the same
to the said Hugh Boscawen, his heirs and assigns, for ever,
who are now in possession thereof. Soon after this fact
Mr. Coke fell into great want and distress, together with
his wife and children, and died suddenly by a slip of his
foot into a shallow pit, wherein he was searching for tin, out
of a conceited opinion he had that he should at last raise
his fortunes by tin, as his grandfather before him had done.</p>

<p>The arms of Coke are, in a field Argent, upon a bend
cotised Sable, three cats Or, with a crescent for distinction
of a second house.</p>

<p>Truth-an, in this parish, parcel of Cargoll manor, held of
the Bishop of Exeter, (that is to say, the trath or trudh-an,
id est, the trout fish,) is the dwelling of John Williams,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 4th of Queen Anne, by lease, who
married Courtney, of Tremeer; his father Maunder; originally
descended from that Williams, of Probus, mentioned
in Carew’s Survey of Cornwall, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140; and giveth
for his arms, Argent, within a bordure enurny and enaluron,
a greyhound in full course Sable.</p>

<p>Tre-worg-an, in this parish, was formerly the lands of
Tencreek, by whose heir it came in marriage to the Polwheles,
and became their seat, till John Polwhele, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>
barrister-at-law, sold it to John Collins, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> now in possession
thereof, who married May, of Truro, and giveth for
his arms, Sable, a chevron gouté of blood Argent, between
three Cornish choughs Proper.</p>

<p>Tre-worg-an Vean, in this parish, parcel of the Duchy
manor of Moris, is the dwelling of Andrew Ley, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> First
Lieutenant of her Majesty’s ship the Medway, that married
Gibbs, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb; and Bourchier, daughter of Henry
Bourchier, Rector of Creed, his father Tonkyn, of Trevawnas;
his grandfather Bligh, and giveth for his arms,
Argent, three pine trees Vert.</p>

<p>Innis, in this parish, that is to say an island, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr> a fresh
water island, a place, as many others in Cornwall, so denominated,
<!--435.png--><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pageno">397</span>
where two rivers, whose original fountains are
above such lands, form between them, in their current towards
the sea, a piece or promontory of land, shaped in
form of a corner, or triangle, at the meeting or confluence of
those two rivers beneath the same (as amnicus, and mediamnis
in the Latin), is the dwelling of Itai Jago, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that
married Bauden, his father Tonkin; his grandfather
Molesworth and Herle, who was steward to Francis Buller,
of Shillington, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> The arms of Jago are &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>As for the name Jago, whether it be derived from the
Celtish, British, Jago, and signifies James, or from Gago,
or Jago, a spear, or military tuck, I determine not, or from
gages and pledges for battle; however, this name was of ancient
use in Britain; for Galfridus Monmouthensis tells us
of a king named Jago, before Julius Cæsar landed in Britain,
that reigned twenty-five years, and lies buried at York.</p>

<p>Trehane, in this parish, i. e. old or ancient town, is the
dwelling of William Courtney, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> a younger branch of
Trethurfe family, that married <a name="err26" id="err26"></a>Seawen, his father Trevanion,
of Tregarthyn, and giveth the same arms as the Trethyrie
Courtneys do.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>A part of this parish is within the manor of Cargaul, belonging
to the Bishop of Exeter, but long held by the Borlases,
of <a name="err27" id="err27"></a>Treladra, on a lease for lives, and under them by
the Jagos, a family of antient standing in this parish.
During the Civil Wars and the subsequent usurpation,
John Jago, of this parish, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> was a Justice of the Peace,
and a mighty sequestrator, so that he got into his possession
the greater part of Mr. Borlase’s estate, and drove his family
to great extremities. Mr. Jago died before the Restoration,
leaving one son by his first wife, a daughter of
John Molesworth, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Pencorrow; and three daughters
by his second wife, a daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Herle, of Prideaux,
<!--436.png--><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a><span class="pageno">398</span>
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and widow of Williams, of Truthon. His three
daughters were married to three Clergymen, to Mr. Charles
Tremayne, Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell; to Mr. Carthew, Vicar of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme; and to Mr. Drinkwater, Vicar of Mevagissey.
His son John Jago enjoyed this and the rest of his father’s
estate till the Restoration; when Mr. Borlase got his own
again, and among the rest this barton, the lease under him
having expired by the death of Mr. John Jago, <abbr title="senior">sen.</abbr> Mr.
Borlase settled Truthon on his son Humphry Borlase on
marriage with a daughter of Sir John Winter, of Sydney,
in Gloucestershire, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> maid of honour to Queen Henrietta
Maria, but had not any children that survived their
infancy, except one son, Nicholas Borlase, who was taken
off in the flower of his youth. Mr. Borlase built here a
very convenient new house, and made it the place of his
constant residence; but Mr. Borlase being deeply engaged
in the interest of the late King James, and Sheriff during
the two last years of his reign, sold his copyhold lease of
Truthon to the before-mentioned Mr. Williams, who was
Sheriff of Cornwall, in the 4th year of Queen Anne, 1705.
He left four sons and three daughters. His eldest son John
Williams, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> now lives here in the commission of the
peace, and as yet unmarried.</p>

<p>The manor of Killigrew, which signifies the Eagle’s
Grove, from Kelly, a Grove, and Eriew or Erigrew, an
Eagle, gave name to that ancient and very eminent family
of Kelligrew, whose seat it was for a long time; till on their
marriage with the heiress of Arwinick, they removed thither,
as being the more pleasant and convenient seat. This place,
however, continued in their possession till the reign of King
James the First, when Sir John Kelligrew first mortgaged
it to his kinsman &mdash;&mdash; Mitchell, of Truro, and after that
dismembered and sold it in parcels. The barton and various
high rents were purchased by the said Mitchell, who
sold them again about the year 1636, to the before mentioned
Mr. Jago, of Truthan, who left the barton to his son
John Jago, who on the recovery of Truthon, by Mr. Borlase,
<!--437.png--><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a><span class="pageno">399</span>
at the Restoration, removed to a farm adjacent, which
his father had purchased with the barton.</p>

<p>Ennis or de Insula, which explains the meaning of the
word, was formerly the seat of the Opies, for here resided,
in Queen Elizabeth’s time, John Opie, <abbr title="senior">sen.</abbr> whose son Robert
Opie, married Jane, the daughter of Agnes Jago, of
this parish, widow, and the said Robert or his son sold the
barton to John Jago. These Opies I take to be a younger
branch of the Opies of Towton, who give for their arms,
Sable, on a chevron, between three garbs Or, as many
hurtleberries Proper.</p>

<p>The above named John Jago married, in 1664, Juliana,
the second daughter of Thomas Tonkin, of Trevawnance,
by whom he had several children; he survived her, and
dying in the early part of this century (i. e. 1700) left the
two bartons of Killigrew and Ennis to his eldest son Itai
Jagoe, who married the daughter of John Bowden, of Trelassick,
in the parish of Ladock, who is still living, but has
sold the manor or manors to Robert Corker, of Falmouth,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> lately deceased, reserving to himself the barton of
Ennis, and a part of the barton of Killigrew on lease. The
arms of Jagoe are, Argent, a plough Proper, between three
fleurs-de-lis Azure (Mr. Lysons says, Or, a chevron between
three cross crosslets Sable.) Mr. Itai Jagoe has
since sold the fee of Ennis to John Stephens of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> reserving to himself the lease for three lives; which
Mr. Stephens, has this March, 1737, bought also the manor
of Killigrew of Sir J. Molesworth and Edmund Prideaux,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Polglase is not far from Killigrew, and was anciently a
part of that manor. It signifies the green pool, and was
sold by the above-named Sir John Killigrew to John Luxton,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> inter alia, in the 8th year of King James the First,
who, two years afterwards, sold it to John Rosogan, <abbr title="senior">sen.</abbr> of
the Rosogans of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen in Bronnel, who came to live
in this place, and left it to his son John Rosogan, of Lyon’s
Inn, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> This John Rosogan married in 1632 Elizabeth,
<!--438.png--><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a><span class="pageno">400</span>
the daughter of John Haulsey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> by whom he had one
daughter, Elizabeth, married to Edward Westbury, of
Winston Westbury, in the County of Southampton, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>
and they joined in conveying this estate, January the 20th,
1660, to Thomas Tonkin, of Trevawnance, in whose posterity
it still continues.</p>

<p>The arms of Rosogan are, Argent, a chevron between
three roses Gules, bearded Proper, seeded Or.</p>

<p>To the south is Trevillon. This was the seat of a
younger branch of the Langhernes, for here, in the reign of
Edward the First, lived Thomas Langherne, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> and
this place continued in his posterity till the reign of Charles
the Second.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>Cornwall is indebted to this parish for introducing the
very respectable family which now (1833) gives a member
for the County.</p>

<p>The advowson has belonged in succession to the families
of Luttrell and Wynne. Doctor William Stackhouse is
said to have acquired this living by exchange, but it appears
to be more probable, on account of his connection
with the patrons, that the presentation came immediately
from them. He was the brother of the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Thomas Stackhouse,
Vicar of Benham, in Berkshire, author of the well
known History of the Bible, first published in 1732, in two
volumes folio, and of various other works.</p>

<p>Doctor William Stackhouse resided on his living, and
there married the heiress of the parish, Miss Williams, of
Trehane. He had two sons, William, who married and
spent his life at Trehane, and lived till June 1830, in his
ninetieth year; and John, to whom Mrs. Perceval, heiress of
the Pendarveses, of Pendarves, in Cambourne gave her whole
estate. Mr. John Stackhouse married Miss Acton, of Acton
Scot, near Church Stretton, in Shropshire, and acquired
with her a very extensive property, which through the liberality
of Mrs. Stackhouse (living in 1833) is possessed by
<!--439.png--><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a><span class="pageno">401</span>
hes second son, on whom the estate was settled after her
decease;<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_43" id="fnanchor_43"></a><a href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></span>
and through a similar act of liberality on the part of
his father, Mr. Edward William Stackhouse, the eldest son,
had the property in Cornwall placed in his possession on
his marriage with Miss Trist, an extensive heiress in Devonshire.</p>

<p>This gentleman has moreover derived a very considerable
addition to his fortune by the will of the Reverend Doctor
Wynne, patron and some time Rector of this parish, and
in remembrance of the family of Pendarves, and of the family
of Wynne, to both of which he is related, and from
both of which he has obtained ample possessions, Mr. Stackhouse
has exchanged his original name for those of Wynne
Pendarves, under which he now represents the County in
Parliament. Mr. Pendarves has erected a monument to
Dr. Wynne, on the western wall of the cloisters of Westminster
Abbey, with the following inscription:</p>

The manor of Pelsew, or Peldu, in this parish, is said
by Mr. Lysons to have belonged to Robert Earl of Cornwall
at the period of the Domesday Survey; that it was
forfeited by John Vere, Earl of Oxford, to Edward the
Fourth, in 1471; and that it passed through the families
of Mapowder and Luttrell to Doctor Wynne, conveying
with it the advowson of the church. Dr. Wynne held the
rectory for many years on his own presentation, deputing
the care of his parish to the very eminent scholar and preceptor
Dr. Cardew; but when residence became necessary
for all incumbents, under the provisions of an act of parliament,
he bestowed the living on the distinguished individual
who had long been his curate. Dr. Cardew departed
from this life in December 1831, having advanced
into his 84th year. A monument is placed to his memory
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erme church, bearing an inscription written by
himself, which might otherwise have the unusual blame
imputed to it, of not sufficiently recording the merits of him
whom it is intended to praise:</p>

by Dr. Wynne to Mr. Pendarves, who is in consequence
patron of the church. Present incumbent, Mr. Pomery.</p>

<p>Treworgan and Truthan are now the property of Mr.

<p>Truthen, with the whole manor of Corgol, was acquired
by the late Sir Christopher Hawkins from the See of Exeter
in 1805, under the act of Parliament for redeeming
land tax, and since his decease Mr. Collins has purchased
the freehold of Truthen, and resides there.</p>

of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, descended to his only surviving son,
Mr. Samuel Stephens, Member for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, about the year
1750, who built the house at Tregenna; and it has passed
from him, by will, to his second son, the late Samuel
Stephens, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> who also represented <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, and who resided

Trembleigh, Trembleth, alias Trembleith, alias Tremblot,
(see <span class="sc">Tremblethick</span>, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mabyn) synonymous
terms, signifies the wolf’s town.</p>

<p>From this place was denominated an ancient family of
gentlemen, surnamed De Trembleth; who, suitable to
their name, gave the wolf for their arms; whose sole inheretrix,
about Henry the Second’s time, was married to
John de Arundel, ancestor of the Arundels of Lanherne;
who, out of respect and grateful remembrance of the great
benefit they had by this match, ever since gave the wolf for
their crest, the proper arms of Trembleth.</p>

<p>In this town they had their domestic chapel and burying
place, now totally gone to decay, since those Arundels removed
from hence to Lanherne. This manor was anciently
held of the manor of Payton, by the tenure of knight’s service.
And here John de Arundel held a knight’s fee
(Morton, <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>) as I am informed. In digging
up the grounds of this old chapel and burial-place not long
since, was found an urn, wherein were contained certain
pieces of bones, ashes, and coals. The remains of some
human creature, that after death had his body burnt, and
committed to that kind of burial; which must be at least
1500 years past.</p>

<p>Tre-ranall, alias Tre-ranell, alias Tre-renell, (synonymous
words,) in this parish, is the dwelling of George Beare,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Lanyon; his father Arundel of Lanherne;
his grandfather Keate; and giveth for his arms,
after the English, in allusion to his name, in a field &mdash;&mdash;
a bear &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>The barton of Trembleigh aforesaid is exempt and free
from paying tithe, either great or small, to the rector, by
reason, as tradition saith, there was a bargain or compact
made betwixt the Trembleiths or Arundels, lords thereof,
the Prior of Bodmin, and the Rector of the said church, at
such time as it was first endowed, that the possessors or
owners of the said barton’s land should for ever annually
pay upon the high altar, to the said Rector, the full sum of
ten shillings.</p>

<p>At Treravall, in this parish, lived George Bere, the representative
of a very ancient family. There was formerly
in the hundred of West a family of the same name, of
great wealth and account in Henry the Eighth’s days;
but whether or not related to this family, I cannot resolve.
Their great estate went with a daughter and heiress to
John Bevill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 16th <abbr title="Elizabeth">Eliz.</abbr> and was
no small advancer of that gentleman’s estate, at that time
much impaired, by the elder brother’s daughter. Their
arms are to be seen in the windows and seats of Leskeard
church, where they had much lands.</p>

<p>In this parish is a manor called Trenowith, or the new
town; and on it resided for many generations the family
of Hare, who give for their arms, Azure, on a bend Argent
three Torteauxes.</p>

particularly was the purchaser of this manor and barton of

himself. He was again, because of his great advancement

<p>At the time of the Domesday Tax, 20 William <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> 1087,
this district was taxed under the jurisdiction of Bicketone,
id est, little town, then and long before, by prescription, the
voke lands of a manor, barton, and court leet; the same
now extant by the name of Tre-bighe, or Tre-bicke, that is
town little; but not so little but that it was a kind of franchise
royal, exempted and privileged in some respects
against the common law, and within its precincts held pleas
of debt and damages before the steward thereof, life, land,
and limb, excepted, and had its prison and bailiff for the
public service, as the hundred courts have. Now the writ
to remove an action at law depending in this court must be
thus directed: Senescallo et Ballivo Manerii sui de Trebiche,
alias Trebighe, in comitatu Cornubiæ salutem.</p>

<p>This lordship was either by King Stephen or King
Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> given to the Knights Hospitallers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
Baptist of Jerusalem, about the year 1150; (who endowed
this church as aforesaid), where they had their preceptory or
commandery, a corporation under a preceptor or commander,
who took care of all their revenues, lands, and tenements,
churches, chapels, and tithes; and those, their
churches, were wholly appropriated to them, though they
were not in holy orders, to preach or administer the Sacraments.
These followed the rules of Augustine and Bernard.</p>

<p>This order originated in the time of the first Crusade,
about the year 1100, when the members were called Knights
of the Military Hospital of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John Baptist of Jerusalem.
They were most amply endowed throughout Christendom,
<!--449.png--><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a><span class="pageno">411</span>
and especially from the spoils of the Knights’ Templars.
The prior of the order for England, had his residence in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John-street, London, and was accounted the first Baron of
the land.</p>

<p>When the Franks were driven from Jerusalem and the
whole of Palestine, this order of monastic warriors took refuge
in the Isle of Rhodes, where it continued to rule till
the Turks expelled them in 1523. The Island of Malta
was then given to them by the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
where they have remained as Knights of Malta, opposing
an impenetrable barrier against the progress of the Turks.</p>

<p>In the 31st year of Henry the Eighth, all the possessions
of the Knights of Malta in England were seized, together
with all other monastic property; and the last prior of the
English, William Weston, is said to have died from grief.</p>

<p>This lordship of Trebich, or Trebigh, passed from
Henry the Eighth to John Wrey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, and from him to
John Wrey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Sheriff of Cornwall 28th of Elizabeth,
that married Killigrew, and had issue by her William
Wrey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> afterwards knighted, that married Courtney of
Powderham, Sheriff of Cornwall 41st of Elizabeth; and
had issue William Wrey, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> created the 209th Baronet
of England, that married and had issue Sir William
or Sir Chichester Wrey, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> that married Frances
daughter of Richard Bourchier, the fifth Earl of Bath, who
by her had issue Sir Bourchier Wrey, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> that married
Rolle of Stephenston, now in possession thereof; who also,
for that his uncle, Henry Bourchier, sixth Earl of Bath,
died without issue, in right of his mother is become one of
his heirs. The arms of Wrey are, Sable, a fess between
three hatchets Argent.</p>

<p>Hay, in this parish, is the residence of Thomas Dodson,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> a commissioner for the peace and taxes, and burgess
in this parliament (1702) for Liskeard. He married a
daughter of John Buller, of Morvell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>; his father a
<!--450.png--><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a><span class="pageno">412</span>
daughter of Lidley. Originally from the Dodsons of London.
Their arms, Argent, a bend engrailed Azure, between
two birds Sable; quartering, Argent, an etoile Gules.</p>

<p>The parish is so called from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ivo, or Ives, a Persian
bishop, as says Mr. Camden; who, they write, about the
year 600, travelled over England with a great reputation
of sanctity, all the way carefully preaching the Gospel, and
left his name to this place, where he left his body too,
meaning <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ive’s, in Huntingdonshire. Perhaps in his
peregrination, though <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vix credo</i>, he might take this place
in his way.</p>

<p>Trebigh manor had formerly lords of its own name,
from whom is descended the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> George Treby, of
Plymston, in Devonshire, Master of his Majesty’s Household,
and some time Secretary at War, only son of the
late Lord Chief Justice Treby. He bears, Sable, a lion
rampant Argent, armed and langued Gules, three Plates
in chief.</p>

<p>The manor of Bickton was one of the 288 manors in this
county given by the Conqueror to Robert Earl of Morton
with the Earldom of Cornwall. Under him, I suppose, it
was held by a family of the same name, Bickton, who gave
for their arms, Gules, a fess Or between four fleurs-de-lis
Argent in chief, and three annulets in base of the Second.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p>The town and parish of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ives, in Penwith, are universally
believed to have for their patroness a female missionary
from Ireland. The ruins of an old fortress is there
called Dinas Iva; and various other circumstances tend to
confirm the tradition. It seems to be much more likely,
therefore, that another parish in Cornwall should be dedicated
to the same person, than to a Persian bishop, of
whose pilgrimage to England there can be little assurance.</p>

<p>The church stands on the top of a hill; and the tower
is remarkable from the circumstance of having the two
buttresses at each corner, as well as the corner itself, terminated
<!--451.png--><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span class="pageno">413</span>
by a pinnacle, making twelve in all. The patronage
is in the Duke of Cornwall.</p>

But, when all that is said or done in this matter, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Tue
may be a corruption of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hugh, the tutelar guardian and
patron of this church’s name; who, in all probability, was
either <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hugh, the twenty-sixth Bishop of Lincoln,
1186, who died 1203, or <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hugh who was also born and
lived at Lincoln, as Copgrave out of Matthew Paris informs
us; who was stolen from his parents at nine years
old by the barbarous and bloody Jews (first brought and
tolerated in England by William the Conqueror), who, in
derision of Christ and Christianity, in a private place, was
by them inhumanly crucified, the 7th of July, 1255.
Nevertheless, this fact was not so secretly performed but
that at length it came to the magistrates’ ears, who thereupon
apprehended the malefactors, and so ordered their
indictment that severe justice was done upon all those
offenders, that could be discovered to have had a hand in
shedding the blood of this innocent youth. But, alas! this
punishment of part of them did neither fully content or
satisfy the prince or people at that time; for soon after
King Henry the Third, by proclamation, set out all Jews
in his dominions at a certain rent to such as would poll
and rifle them, and amongst others to his brother Richard
King of the Romans; who, after he had plundered their
estates, committed their bodies as his slaves, to labour in
his tin-mines of Cornwall; the memory of whose workings
is still preserved in the names of several tin-works, called
Towle Sarasin, and corruptly Attall Saracen, i. e. the
refuse or outcast of the Saracens; that is to say, of those
Jews descended from Sarah and Abraham. Other works
were called Whele Etherson, the Jews’ Works, or Unbelievers’
Works, in Cornish.</p>

<p>But, alas! this matter did not rest here; for King Edward
the First, out of an abhorrence of them for the aforesaid
<!--453.png--><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a><span class="pageno">415</span>
crime, and for that they were accused of clipping and
corrupting the sterling money of the kingdom, caused two
hundred and ninety-seven of them to be executed on the
gallows, and the remainder of them by public proclamation
banished out of this land, and all their goods and chattels
confiscated to his use, after they had been in England two-hundred
and twenty-three years. Lastly, Copgrave further
assures us, who lived tempore Edward the Fourth, that at
the shrine of this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hugh at Lincoln, divers supernatural
facts or miracles were done; for which reason he was put
into the Catalogue of Roman Saints. Hugh, ugh, in
British-Cornish, is a matter or thing high, large, and lofty.</p>

<p>In this parish is the barton and manor of Lan-hadarn,
alias Lanhaddarne, alias Lanhadden, alias Lansladarne,
the thieves’ or robbers’ place.</p>

<p>Which place gave name and original to an old family
of gentlemen, from thence surnamed de Lanhaddarne; of
which family was Serlo de Lanhaddarne, called by writ of
summons to Parliament as a Baron tempore Edward the
First or Second: of whose posterity Serlo de Lanhaddarne,
3 Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> held in this place Guran and Lantine, by the
tenure of knight service, one fee and a half of lands; whose
issue male failing in Henry the Sixth’s days, he left only
two daughters, that became his heirs, the one married to
Sir John Arundel, of Lanherne, Knight, the other to Sir
John Arundel, Knight, of Trerice; in whose issue the
name, blood, and estate of those gentlemen is terminated;
which was no small augmentation of the wealth and revenues
of those Arundels; and as the present possessor of this
lordship, Sir John Arundel, of Lanherne, Knight, hath for
many years made of his toll-tin out of the wastrel lands
thereof at Tolgoath above fifteen hundred pounds per annum;
so in like manner the Lord Arundel of Trerice, out
of the manor of Allett in Kenwen, at a place called the
Garrows, parcel of those Lanhaddarns’ lands, hath had
considerable benefit from an ancient lead-mine there, out
of which divers thousand pounds’ worth of lead and silver
have been extracted. (See <span class="sc">Kenwen</span>.)</p>

Treg-on-an, in this parish, i. e. the dwelling on the valley
or on the level valley, is the seat of Sir Joseph Tredinham,
Knight, that married the daughter of Sir Edward Seymour,
of Berry Pomeroye, in Devon, <abbr title="Baronet">Bart.</abbr> His father, an
attorney-at-law, married the daughter of Molesworth, of
Pencarrow, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr></p>

<p>Sir Joseph Tredingham succeeded to his estate, upon
the issueless decease of his elder brother, Sir William Tredingham,
Knight; and had issue by &mdash;&mdash; Seymour, John
Tredinham, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Member of Parliament for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mawes,
that married &mdash;&mdash; Jones, of Wales, as I take it, but died
without issue by a fall from his coachbox; and also two
daughters, the eldest married to John Nicholls, of Trewane,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> the other to Francis Scobell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Member of
Parliament for Mitchell, now in possession of this lordship,
and all other Sir Joseph’s lands, greatly encumbered with
debts.</p>

<p>Hal-liggon, in this parish, is the dwelling of Sir John
Tremayne, Knight, serjeant-at-law, who married, but died
without issue. His father, Colonel Lewis Tremayne, married
&mdash;&mdash; Carew, of Penwarne, by whom also he had issue
&mdash;&mdash; Tremayne, Clerk, Vicar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, whose son by
&mdash;&mdash; Jagoe, &mdash;&mdash; Tremayne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> is now in possession of this
barton and manor, who married Clotworthy’s heir. Originally
this family was descended from the Tremaynes of
Collacomb, in Devon (for which see <span class="sc">Mabe</span>).</p>

<p>Tre-vethick, alias Trevithick, in this parish, i. e. the
farmer, rustic, or husbandman’s town, is the dwelling of
John Hickes, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> Commissioner for the Peace and Taxes,
and sometime Member of Parliament for Fowey, who
married &mdash;&mdash;; his father an attorney-at-law.</p>

<p>This gentleman’s father came to an untimely death by
means of an unskilful nurse that attended him in his sickness,
who being prescribed a medicine by the physician,
wherein was to be compounded, amongst others, (the herb)
mercury, which the woman not understanding, bought of
the apothecary the poisonous drug mercury, or crocus metolorum,
<!--455.png--><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a><span class="pageno">417</span>
instead thereof, which being administered to him
soon caused his death.</p>

<p>In like manner a son of his, named Stephen Hickes, a
youth of about eighteen years of age, at school with Mr.
Halsey at Merther, carrying about a birding-gun charged
with powder and shot in his hand, the gun accidentally
went off at such time as the mouth thereof was opposite to
his body, which shot him dead through the breast and
heart, to the grief of all that knew him.</p>

<p>Tre-luick, alias Tre-luige, in this parish, signifies the
lake or river of water town, or the town whose lands are
situate upon some river or bosom of waters, is the dwelling
of John Archer, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> that married Addis; his father &mdash;&mdash;
Archer, Clerk, Vicar of Manaccan, married Sweet.</p>

<p>This I take to be that place taxed in the Domesday
Book, 1087, as the voke lands of some manor, by the
name of Treluwe, or else Treluick, in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Allen parish.</p>

<p class="p2 center small">TONKIN.</p>

<p>This parish is dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Eva or Ewe, not from
our grandmother Eve. It is a rectory, and in the gift of
Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn and Dr. John Hawkins, from the
Tredinhams.</p>

<p>Various manors are situated in this parish. Pelrew, i. e.
the black park, includes two bartons, distinguished by the
names of Trevelisick Wartha and Trevalisick Wallas, that
is, the higher and lower, and belong to William Seccombe,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who gives for his arms, Argent, a fess Gules between
three lions rampant Sable.</p>

<p>Adjoining to these lands is Trelisick; for the meaning
of which see <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth, a part of the said manor, but the
property of Mr. Tremayne.</p>

<p>The manor of Precays. This being part of the possessions
of Sir Henry Bodrigan, was on his attainder <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
alia</i> given by Henry the Seventh to Sir Richard Edgecumbe,
Comptroller of his household, in whose posterity it
<!--456.png--><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pageno">418</span>
now continues; the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr> Richard Edgecumbe being the
present lord of this manor.</p>

<p>To speak now of the most noted places, the first we
come to, and which joins with Trelisick in Tregonan,
that is, the town on the downs, formerly the property
of the Tredenhams; but on the death of John Tredenham,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> at Westminster, December the 25th, 1710, a gentleman
of very bright parts and of great loyalty, which he
often shewed in Parliament, this barton came to his second
sister, Mary, the wife of Francis Scobell, <abbr title="esquire">esq.</abbr> who makes
this place his residence.</p>

<p>Next the manor of Treworick, that is, the town on the
river, called in Domesday Book Treworoc, was one of the
manors given by William the Conqueror to Robert Earl
of Morton. This was also a part of the property forfeited
by Sir Henry Bodrigan, and given to Sir Richard Edgecumbe.</p>

<p>The manor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe or Eva, so called from the name
of the parish. The church and glebe being taken out of
it, and the advowson being still appurtenant, was anciently
the inheritance of the family of Coleshul. Sir John Coleshul,
slain at the battle of Agincourt, left a son of the same
name, Sir John Coleshul, Sheriff of Cornwall the 17th
Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> and the 7th Edward <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> who dying without
issue his sister Joan, married to Sir Remfry Arundel, became
his heir.</p>

<p>Sir John <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn possesses one fifth and one sixtieth,
or thirteen sixtieths of this property; the remaining
parts came through different hands at last to Sir John Tredenham
of Tregoran, and were sold, with the greatest part
of the Tredenham estates, to Francis Scobell, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> in 1727;
so that John Hawkins, of <a name="pennemer" id="pennemer"></a>Pennemer, D.D. and Sir John
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubyn, are the actual proprietors.</p>

<p>Not far from the church, as the name signifies, a tenement
called Lanewa, lately the seat, under the said lords,
of George Slade, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> till he removed to Trevisick, in
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell.</p>

<p><!--457.png--><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pageno">419</span>
The manor of Heligon was anciently the inheritance of
the Whitleighs, of Efford, in Devonshire. Richard Whitleigh,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> had two daughters and heirs, Joanna, married
to Richard Hals, of Kenedon, in Devonshire, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and
Margaret to Roger Granville, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Stow, between whom
this and many more manors were divided. Roger and
Margaret Granville gave their part of this manor to their
third son, Degorie Granville, of Penheale, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> and in the
28th year of Henry the Eighth John Hals, of Efford, and
his son Richard Hals, sold their half of the manor to
Sampson Tremayne, senior, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe: and, on the 8th
of May, in the 10th year of Queen Elizabeth, Richard
Granville, of Penhele, sold the other half to the said Sampson
Tremayne, and the whole is now enjoyed by his descendant
John Tremayne, who married in 1735 Grace, the
youngest daughter, and in a manner sole heiress, of Henry
Hawkins, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austel, attorney-at-law.</p>

<p>Sir John Tremayne, serjeant-at-law, built the present
house, in addition to some rooms of an old house in the
same place. Those places, called Kestell, that is, castle,
belong to the manor. Kestell Wartha, the Middle Castle,
and Kestel Wallas, but why so named I cannot learn,
there not being the least remains of any fortification. Kestell
Wartha, or the higher castle, was for a time the residence
of Lewis Tremayne, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> during the life of his
father. This gentleman, great-grandfather of Mr. John
Tremayne, the present possessor, was then a lieutenant-colonel
under King Charles the First, and a very stout
honest man.</p>

<p>The manor of Coran is now become a part of the manor
of Pentnar, in Mevassary, the lord of which is the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
John Roberts.</p>

<p>Lanhedrar, the seat of thieves, belonged to Robert Earl
of Morton. Serlo de Lanhedrar, of this place, had summons
as a Baron, and also to attend the King beyond the
seas, 25th Edward the First.</p>

<p>Lower Lanhedrar was the seat by lease under the Arundels,
<!--458.png--><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pageno">420</span>
of Thomas Maunder, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> who left three daughters
his coheirs: Mary married to Henwood, Priscilla to John
Wolridge, of Gorminick, the third to John Williams, who
lived at Tregenna.</p>

<p>To the northward of Lanhedrar, is Trelean, memorable,
or rather infamous, for having been the birthplace of that
trumpeter of rebellion Hugh Peters, as the late Mr. Lewis
Tremayne has often assured me.</p>

<p>Next to this is Rosecorla, that is, the valley of the sheepfold,
lately the seat, in lease too from the Arundels, of
Edward Maunder, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr></p>

<p>Next is Trelewick. This seems to have been anciently
a manor of itself, although long since disfranchised. It is
now the seat of William Archer, a minor. His father,
John Archer, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> married &mdash;&mdash; Adis, of Plymouth. The
arms of Archer are, Sable, a chevron engrailed between
three sheens (i. e. spear-heads) Or.</p>

<p>The manor of Tregian gave name to the noted family of
Tregian, and was their chief seat till they removed to Golden
in Probus, when the ancient seat fell into decay, so
that no traces are now left. This, with the rest of Mr.
Tregian’s great estate, was forfeited, as will be stated
under Probus.</p>

<p>Pensiquillis, the head of the dry copes, or the dry hill of
wood, was the last seat of the Penkevills, in this county;
where they retired after they had sold off the greatest
of their considerable estates therein. The last heir-male of
this ancient family, Benjamin Penkivill, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> died here unmarried,
of the smallpox, the 21st of November, 1699,
leaving his six sisters co-heirs.</p>

<p>To the north of this place is Lithony, commonly Luny,
and is the modern seat of the Mohuns. Warwick Mohun,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> on his marriage with &mdash;&mdash;, daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Adis,
<abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> built a house here in his father’s lifetime, where he
resided till his death, which happened on the road to London
in October 1736.</p>

<p>To the south is Borew, the bleak dwelling, but why so
<!--459.png--><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a><span class="pageno">421</span>
called I cannot guess. This was formerly the seat of
Cruffs, on lease from the Arundels.</p>

<p>And next to that is Tregenno, the town of the mouth or
entrance, as I believe from the situation of its chief place
just by the downs. This manor was for several generations
the seat, on lease under the Arundels, of the family of
Robins; the last of which, Stephen Robins, resided for the
most part in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Winnow. It has since been the dwelling
of Richard Randyl, <abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr> whose arms are, Gules, on a
cross Argent, three mullets pierced Sable.</p>

<p>Further south lies Levalra, where lived Hugh Henwood,
<abbr title="Gentleman">Gent.</abbr>; but, on his decease in 1733, the place was sold.</p>

<p>To the north of Tregenno is the manor of Penstruan,
that is, the head of the springs. This was a part of Sir
Henry Rodrigan’s forfeited estate, and came by grant to
the Edgecumbes.</p>

<p>I now come to the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe, which consists of
a nave, a south aile, a vestry to the north, and a cross aile,
At the western end is a square tower, with a steeple on the
top, in which are three bells. Some of the windows have
painted glass; in one, an angel holds in his hands an
escutcheon, charged, Azure, on a fess Sable, three chevronels
sideways of the Field. The church plate is very handsome.
On the flaggon is inscribed:</p>

<p class="center">Jacobus Robins, de Tregennoe, Arm.<br />
      nuper expirans<br />
      ex voto legavit.</p>

<p>On the cover: St Ewe.</p>

<p>On the cup: Εις Ευχαρισταν.</p>

<p>In the north-west corner of the churchyard is a rough
altar tomb, without an inscription visible at present, but
tradition says it had formerly the following:</p>

<div class="poemnormal">
<div class="i0">Here lies Parson Hugh,</div>
<div class="i0">The famous Atwell, Rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe.</div>
</div>

<p>The church is built low, and at one end of the parish.
<!--460.png--><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a><span class="pageno">422</span>
It had formerly but a low wooden cover for two bells; but
the parishioners have taken that down, and are this present
year, 1732, erecting a handsome square tower, at their own
sole charge, wherein they design to have a ring of three
bells.</p>

<p>In the nave, against the wall, is a small monument with
this inscription:</p>

<p class="p2 center small">THE EDITOR.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Ewe has to lament the loss of all the gentlemen’s
families, with the exception of one, which are stated to
have resided there in former times; but that one may well
compensate for the absence of all the others.</p>

<p>Mr. John Tremayne, who married Grace, the youngest
<!--461.png--><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pageno">423</span>
daughter of Mr. Henry Hawkins, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell, had
two sons, and a daughter married to Mr. Charles Rashleigh,
of Desporth, as has been noticed under <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austel.
The eldest son, Lewis, died in the prime of life, when the
second son, who had taken orders, became the heir of his
family.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Henry Hawkins Tremayne married Harriet,
daughter and coheir of John Hearle, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr> of Penryn, and
of her mother heiress of the Paynters of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Erth. They
have left an only son, John Hearle Tremayne, married to
Caroline, daughter of the late Sir William Lemon.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say too much in praise of the late Mr.
Henry Hawkins Tremayne: possessed of good abilities,
of a sound understanding, of practical knowledge of business,
and of the utmost kindness of heart, he became the
father of his neighbourhood, reconciling all disputes, adjusting
all differences, and tempering the administration of
justice with lenity and forbearance. So high and so extensive
was the reputation of Mr. Tremayne throughout the
whole county, that his son, buoyant on the father’s virtues,
and before opportunities were afforded for displaying his
own, passed by an unanimous election into the high station
of representative for Cornwall; but experience soon
proved that Mr. John Hearle Tremayne wanted no assistance
from hereditary claims to make him worthy of that, or
of any other distinction. And the Editor takes this opportunity
of repeating what he had the honour of addressing
to a county meeting, previously to Mr. Tremayne’s declaration
of not allowing himself to be elected for the sixth
time, to avoid the embroilment of a contest:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“<cite>I have had the happiness of witnessing Mr. Tremayne’s
conduct in Parliament for twenty years; and knowing the
high estimation in which he is held by all parties, and by all
sides of the House of Commons, I venture to assert that
Cornwall would fall in public opinion if Mr. Tremayne
were not again returned, let his successor be who he may.</cite>”</p>

<h3 class="p4 h3head">Transcriber’s Note:</h3>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words and names had not
become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple
spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These
have been left unchanged. Also unchanged were misspelled words,
incorrect use of homonyms, and sentences without verbs. The editor
used a string dashes, dots, or spaces of various lengths to indicate omitted
text. These are replicated as long dashes: &mdash;&mdash;. Insular letters were replaced
with contemporary equivalents.</p>

<p>Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside down, missing or
partially printed letters, were corrected. Unprinted punctuation and
final stops missing at the end of abbreviations and sentences were
added. Duplicated words were removed, as were duplicate letters after
rejoining words that were hyphenated at the end of a line. Carats
were used to indicate superscripts in the inscription in the
chapter on St. Ewe.</p>

<p>Footnotes were numbered in order and moved to the end of the
chapter in which the related anchors occur. The anchor for Footnote
<a href="#fnanchor_17"><span class="small">[17]</span></a> was missing
in the original; it was added where it likely should have been.
There are two anchors to Footnote <span class="lock"><a href="#footnote_39">[39]</a></span>.
Return link from the footnote to the text is provided to the first anchor.</p>

<p>The Geology section of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Colomb Major was printed twice including
the population section of the preceding table. At the end of the
second geology section were two paragraphs about Castle-An-Dinas that
do not discuss geology. <a name="repair" id="repair"></a>The three duplicated geology paragraphs were
deleted and the two paragraphs about the castle were moved to precede
the table of parish property values.</p>

<p>Noted, not changed:</p>
<ul>
 <li>In the section for St. Anthony in Powder, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine <a href="#rule">rules of order</a> omits item number 4.</li>
 <li>Total <a href="#population">population of Bodmin</a> in 1811 does not equal the sum of items in the table.</li>
 <li>In the section of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clement’s, the year <a href="#Condurus">1016</a> should likely be 1066.</li>
</ul>
<p>The book contains the following pen and ink changes made by an unknown
hand. The changes were not made to the text, but are indicated below in
parentheses:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#penconnow">Penconnow</a> (Pencarrow)</li>
 <li><a href="#foow">Foow</a> (Foote)</li>
 <li><a href="#pennemer">Pennemer</a> (Pennance)</li>
 <li><a href="#err15">sine</a> (sive)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Index appears only at the end of Volume 4. It is reproduced
here for the convenience of readers. Links are provided only to items
in this volume. Page numbers for Index items occasionally are missing in
the original.</p>
